# **3. Basic SQL Queries**

## **1. SELECT Statement**

The **SELECT** statement is used to **retrieve data** from one or more tables in a database. It is the most common SQL command and can be as simple as selecting all columns from a table, or as complex as selecting specific columns with conditions.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

## **Example 1: Retrieve All Data from a Table**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

* This will retrieve all rows and all columns from the `employees` table.

## **Example 2: Retrieve Specific Columns**

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM employees;
```

* This will only retrieve the `name` and `age` columns from the `employees` table.

---

## **2. WHERE Clause**

The **WHERE** clause is used to filter records based on a specified condition. It allows you to retrieve only the rows that meet a certain condition, such as finding employees who work in a specific department or customers who live in a particular city.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## **Example 1: Filtering Data**

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR';
```

* This will return only the employees from the `HR` department.

## **Example 2: Using Comparison Operators**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

* This will return employees with a salary greater than `50000`.

## **Example 3: Using Logical Operators**

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR' AND age > 30;
```

* This will return employees from the `HR` department who are older than 30.

---

## **3. DISTINCT**

The **DISTINCT** keyword is used to return **unique values** by removing duplicates from the result set. This is useful when you want to find distinct values for a particular column.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name;
```

## **Example 1: Retrieve Unique Departments**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;
```

* This will return a list of distinct departments from the `employees` table, eliminating any duplicates.

## **Example 2: Retrieve Unique Age and Department Combinations**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT age, department
FROM employees;
```

* This will return all unique combinations of `age` and `department` from the `employees` table.

---

## **4. LIMIT / OFFSET**

The **LIMIT** and **OFFSET** clauses are used to **restrict the number of rows** returned by a query. This is particularly useful for pagination or when you want to limit the results returned.

* **LIMIT**: Specifies the maximum number of records to return.
* **OFFSET**: Skips a specified number of rows before beginning to return rows.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows OFFSET number_of_rows_to_skip;
```

## **Example 1: Retrieve First 5 Records**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 5;
```

* This will return only the first 5 rows from the `employees` table.

## **Example 2: Skip First 5 Records and Retrieve Next 5**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;
```

* This will skip the first 5 records and then return the next 5 records from the `employees` table.

## **Example 3: Pagination (Get Records 11 to 20)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
```

* This will retrieve records 11 through 20 from the `employees` table.

## **Combining SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, LIMIT / OFFSET**

You can combine all these components in a single query to perform more complex searches.

## **Example 1: Retrieve Unique Departments of Employees from Age 30 and Above**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees
WHERE age >= 30;
```

## **Example 2: Retrieve First 10 Employees with Salary Above 60000**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000
LIMIT 10;
```

## **Example 3: Skip the First 20 Employees with Salary Above 40000**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 40000
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

---

## **Summary**

* **SELECT**: Retrieves data from a table. You can specify the columns you want to retrieve.
* **WHERE**: Filters the data based on a specified condition.
* **DISTINCT**: Returns unique values for the specified column(s).
* **LIMIT / OFFSET**: Restricts the number of rows returned and helps with pagination by skipping a specified number of rows.

These basic SQL commands form the foundation for querying and filtering data from a database. By mastering these, you will be able to write more complex SQL queries as you progress in your learning.
