# **25. Advanced Joins and Set Operations**

## **1. Multiple Joins**

In SQL, you can join more than two tables in a single query. This is useful when you're working with data that is spread across multiple tables and need to combine it into a single result set.

## **Syntax for Multiple Joins**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column
JOIN table3 ON table2.column = table3.column
WHERE condition;
```

## **Example**: Joining Three Tables

Consider the following tables:

* `employees` (employee\_id, name, department\_id)
* `departments` (department\_id, department\_name)
* `salaries` (employee\_id, salary)

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name, s.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
JOIN salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id;
```

* This query joins the `employees`, `departments`, and `salaries` tables to return the names of employees, their department names, and their corresponding salaries.

## **Key Points**:

* You can join **multiple tables** using `JOIN` clauses.
* Make sure to use the **correct join conditions** to avoid incorrect data.
* You can use **any type of join** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, etc.) when working with multiple joins.

## **2. Complex Join Conditions**

Sometimes, you need to join tables using more than just a simple equality condition. You can use **complex join conditions**, including multiple columns, inequalities, or more complex logic.

## **Example 1: Joining on Multiple Columns**

If you need to join two tables based on more than one column, you can specify multiple columns in the `ON` clause.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name, e.department_id, e.manager_id
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id AND e.manager_id = d.manager_id;
```

* This query joins the `employees` and `departments` tables based on both `department_id` and `manager_id`.

## **Example 2: Joining with Inequality Conditions**

You can join tables using inequalities (e.g., `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).

```sql
SELECT e.name, s.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id AND s.salary >= 50000;
```

* This query returns the names and salaries of employees who earn more than or equal to 50,000.

## **Example 3: Using `OR` or `AND` in Join Conditions**

You can combine multiple conditions in the `ON` clause using logical operators like `OR` and `AND`.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > 50000 OR d.department_name = 'HR';
```

* This query retrieves employee names and department names where the employee earns more than 50,000 **or** the department is `HR`.

## **3. Recursive Joins (Using Common Table Expressions - CTEs)**

**Recursive Joins** are typically used to query hierarchical data, such as organizational structures, where an entity is related to itself (e.g., employees reporting to managers, categories having subcategories).

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is a temporary result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. CTEs are especially useful for recursive queries, as they allow you to reference the result of the query within itself.

## **Syntax for Recursive CTE**:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
    -- Base case: the initial query (non-recursive)
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table
    WHERE condition
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive part: the query that references the CTE
    SELECT t.column1, t.column2
    FROM table t
    JOIN cte_name cte ON t.column = cte.column
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

## **Example 1: Recursive CTE for Hierarchical Data**

Let's say we have an `employees` table that contains employees' information, including the `manager_id` column, which points to the `employee_id` of the employee's manager.

**employees**:

| employee\_id | name  | manager\_id |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| 1            | Alice | NULL        |
| 2            | Bob   | 1           |
| 3            | Carol | 1           |
| 4            | David | 2           |
| 5            | Eve   | 3           |

We want to retrieve the **hierarchical structure** of employees (i.e., employee and their direct reports) in a recursive manner.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: Get the top-level employees (those who have no manager)
    SELECT employee_id, name, manager_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive part: Get the employees who report to someone in the hierarchy
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.manager_id
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
```

## **Result**:

| employee\_id | name  | manager\_id |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| 1            | Alice | NULL        |
| 2            | Bob   | 1           |
| 3            | Carol | 1           |
| 4            | David | 2           |
| 5            | Eve   | 3           |

* This query returns the **hierarchical structure** of employees, starting from those without managers and recursively finding their direct reports.

## **Key Points about Recursive CTEs**:

* Recursive CTEs use **`UNION ALL`** to combine the base case with the recursive part.
* The recursive part references the CTE itself, which allows you to build the hierarchy incrementally.
* Recursive CTEs can be used for hierarchical queries (e.g., org charts, bill-of-materials) or graph-like data structures.

## **4. Performance Considerations for Joins**

When working with multiple joins and complex conditions, itâ€™s essential to consider performance. Here are some tips for optimizing joins:

1. **Indexing**: Ensure that join columns are indexed. This will speed up the lookup for matching rows.
2. **Avoiding Cartesian Products**: Make sure your join conditions are correctly specified to avoid unnecessary Cartesian products (e.g., when there is no `ON` or `WHERE` condition, resulting in every row from one table being joined with every row from another).
3. **Using INNER JOIN**: When possible, prefer `INNER JOIN` over `OUTER JOIN`, as it is typically more efficient because it only returns matching rows.
4. **Use of CTEs**: CTEs can help break down complex queries into manageable parts and improve readability. However, be cautious when using them with recursive queries, as they can be slower for large datasets.
5. **Avoiding Nested Joins in Subqueries**: If possible, try to refactor subqueries with multiple joins into `JOIN` operations to improve readability and performance.

## **Set Operations**

Set operations like **UNION**, **INTERSECT**, and **EXCEPT** allow you to combine results from multiple queries, with specific conditions on how the data is merged or filtered.

## **Conclusion**

* **Multiple Joins**: Allow you to join more than two tables together, and can be used with complex conditions.
* **Complex Join Conditions**: Use conditions such as inequalities or logical operators in the `ON` clause to filter rows.
* **Recursive Joins (CTEs)**: Use Common Table Expressions for hierarchical queries, such as organizational charts or bill-of-materials data.
