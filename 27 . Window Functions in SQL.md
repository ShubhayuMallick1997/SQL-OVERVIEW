# **26. Window Functions in SQL**

## **1. What Are Window Functions?**

A **Window Function** performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. They are similar to aggregate functions, but unlike aggregates, **window functions do not collapse the result set**. Each row retains its identity, and the function operates over a "window" of rows.

Window functions are often used with **`OVER()`** clause, which defines the window (or set of rows) the function should operate on.

## **2. OVER() Clause**

The **`OVER()`** clause is used to define the window of rows over which the window function operates. It can include **`PARTITION BY`** to break the data into subsets (partitions) and **`ORDER BY`** to define the order of rows within each partition.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
window_function() OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY order_column)
```

* **`PARTITION BY`**: Divides the result set into partitions to which the window function is applied. The function is calculated separately for each partition.
* **`ORDER BY`**: Orders the rows within each partition before applying the window function. If `ORDER BY` is not provided, the rows are processed in an unspecified order.

---

## **3. ROW\_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE\_RANK()**

These window functions are used to assign a unique rank or sequential number to rows within a partition.

## **ROW\_NUMBER()**:

* **`ROW_NUMBER()`** assigns a unique, sequential number to each row in the result set. The numbering starts at 1 for the first row in each partition.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column)
```

## **Example**: Row numbers for employees ordered by salary within each department:

```sql
SELECT name, department_id, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;
```

* This assigns a row number to each employee, starting from 1 in each department, ordered by salary in descending order.

## **RANK()**:

* **`RANK()`** assigns a rank to each row in a result set. However, if two rows have the same values in the `ORDER BY` columns, they will receive the same rank, and the next rank will be skipped.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column)
```

## **Example**: Ranking employees by salary within each department:

```sql
SELECT name, department_id, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```

* Employees with the same salary in the same department will get the same rank. If two employees are ranked 1, the next employee will be ranked 3.

## **DENSE\_RANK()**:

* **`DENSE_RANK()`** is similar to `RANK()`, but it does not skip ranks. If two rows have the same rank, the next row will receive the very next rank without gaps.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column)
```

## **Example**: Ranking employees with dense ranking:

```sql
SELECT name, department_id, salary,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
```

* In this case, if two employees have the same salary, they receive the same rank, but the next rank is not skipped.

---

## **4. NTILE(), LEAD(), LAG()**

These are other useful window functions that are often used for statistical analysis or examining rows relative to the current row.

## **NTILE()**:

* **`NTILE()`** divides the result set into a specified number of **buckets** or **tiles**. It is useful for distributing rows evenly into groups, such as quartiles, deciles, etc.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
NTILE(n) OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column)
```

* **`n`**: The number of buckets into which to divide the data.

## **Example**: Dividing employees into 4 salary quartiles:

```sql
SELECT name, department_id, salary,
       NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS quartile
FROM employees;
```

* This divides employees within each department into 4 quartiles based on salary.

## **LEAD()**:

* **`LEAD()`** provides access to a row’s subsequent value. It’s useful for comparing a row to the next row in the result set.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
LEAD(column, offset, default) OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column)
```

* **`column`**: The column from which the next value is retrieved.
* **`offset`**: The number of rows forward from the current row (defaults to 1).
* **`default`**: The value returned if there is no subsequent row (defaults to `NULL`).

## **Example**: Finding the next salary value for each employee:

```sql
SELECT name, department_id, salary,
       LEAD(salary, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS next_salary
FROM employees;
```

* This returns the salary of the next employee in the same department, ordered by salary.

## **LAG()**:

* **`LAG()`** is the opposite of `LEAD()`. It provides access to the previous row’s value.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
LAG(column, offset, default) OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column)
```

* **`column`**: The column from which the previous value is retrieved.
* **`offset`**: The number of rows backward from the current row (defaults to 1).
* **`default`**: The value returned if there is no previous row (defaults to `NULL`).

## **Example**: Finding the previous salary value for each employee:

```sql
SELECT name, department_id, salary,
       LAG(salary, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS prev_salary
FROM employees;
```

* This returns the salary of the previous employee in the same department, ordered by salary.

---

## **5. Windowing with PARTITION BY and ORDER BY**

The **`PARTITION BY`** clause in the **`OVER()`** function divides the result set into partitions (groups of rows). The window function operates on each partition independently.

The **`ORDER BY`** clause is used to order rows within each partition, which is essential for calculating rank-based or ordered calculations (like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`).

## **Example 1: Using PARTITION BY and ORDER BY**

```sql
SELECT name, department_id, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;
```

* This query generates row numbers within each department, ordered by salary in descending order. The `PARTITION BY department_id` ensures the row numbering restarts for each department.

## **Example 2: Using PARTITION BY with Aggregate Functions**

```sql
SELECT name, salary,
       AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS avg_department_salary
FROM employees;
```

* This query calculates the average salary within each department, showing each employee's salary along with the department's average salary.

## **Example 3: Windowing with NTILE**

```sql
SELECT name, department_id, salary,
       NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS quartile
FROM employees;
```

* This query divides employees into 4 salary quartiles within each department.

## **Conclusion**

* **Window functions** provide powerful tools for performing calculations over partitions of data, allowing you to rank, compare, and analyze data in sophisticated ways.
* The **`PARTITION BY`** and **`ORDER BY`** clauses allow you to define the scope and order of your window functions, enabling complex data manipulations.
* **`ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`,** and **`NTILE()`** are among the most commonly used window functions to analyze and rank data across partitions.

These concepts are incredibly useful for performing advanced analysis and comparisons in SQL.
