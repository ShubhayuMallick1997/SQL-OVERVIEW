# **8. Subqueries in SQL**

## **1. What is a Subquery?**

A **subquery** is a query nested inside another query. It is typically used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query. Subqueries can return a single value (scalar), a list of values, or a table of values.

Subqueries are enclosed in parentheses and are often used in the **SELECT**, **WHERE**, and **FROM** clauses.

## **2. Types of Subqueries**

There are two types of subqueries:

* **Non-correlated subqueries**
* **Correlated subqueries**

Letâ€™s first look at how subqueries work in different clauses.

## **3. Subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM Clauses**

## **Subquery in the SELECT Clause**

A subquery in the **SELECT** clause is used to return a value that will be part of the final result set.

### **Example**: Get the salary of the highest-paid employee for each department.

```sql
SELECT department_name,
       (SELECT MAX(salary) 
        FROM employees 
        WHERE department_id = departments.department_id) AS max_salary
FROM departments;
```

* Here, the subquery is in the `SELECT` clause, and it returns the maximum salary for each department.

## **Subquery in the WHERE Clause**

A subquery in the **WHERE** clause is used to filter the results based on the result of another query. It is commonly used with comparison operators such as `IN`, `NOT IN`, `EXISTS`, or `NOT EXISTS`.

### **Example 1**: Get employees whose salary is greater than the average salary.

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

* This subquery calculates the average salary and the main query retrieves employees whose salary is above the average.

### **Example 2**: Get employees working in departments with more than 5 employees.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id 
                         FROM employees 
                         GROUP BY department_id 
                         HAVING COUNT(*) > 5);
```

* This subquery first finds departments with more than 5 employees, and the main query retrieves employees who work in those departments.

## **Subquery in the FROM Clause**

A subquery in the **FROM** clause is used to treat the result of a query as a temporary table. This is known as a **derived table** or **inline view**.

### **Example**: Get the average salary by department using a subquery in the FROM clause.

```sql
SELECT department_name, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM (SELECT department_name, salary
      FROM employees) AS department_salaries
GROUP BY department_name;
```

* The subquery in the `FROM` clause acts as a temporary table (`department_salaries`), and the outer query calculates the average salary by department.

## **4. Correlated vs. Non-correlated Subqueries**

## **Non-correlated Subqueries**

A **non-correlated subquery** is a subquery that can be executed independently of the outer query. The subquery does not reference any columns from the outer query, and its result can be used as a constant value for the outer query.

### **Example**: Get employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of all employees.

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

* The subquery `(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)` is a non-correlated subquery because it does not reference any columns from the outer query. It runs independently and returns a single value (average salary) used by the outer query.

## **Correlated Subqueries**

A **correlated subquery** is a subquery that **depends on the outer query**. The subquery references columns from the outer query, and for each row processed by the outer query, the subquery is re-executed.

### **Example**: Get employees whose salary is higher than the average salary in their own department.

```sql
SELECT name, salary, department_id
FROM employees outer_emp
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary)
                 FROM employees inner_emp
                 WHERE inner_emp.department_id = outer_emp.department_id);
```

* The subquery references `outer_emp.department_id` from the outer query. For each employee in the outer query, the subquery calculates the average salary for that specific department. The subquery is correlated because it depends on the outer query.

## **Key Differences between Correlated and Non-correlated Subqueries**:

| **Feature**          | **Non-correlated Subquery**                                     | **Correlated Subquery**                                                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dependency**       | Does not depend on the outer query.                             | Depends on the outer query.                                                      |
| **Execution**        | Executes once and provides a single value.                      | Executes once for each row in the outer query.                                   |
| **Example Use Case** | Used for comparing values across all rows.                      | Used when comparing values per row (e.g., by department).                        |
| **Performance**      | Generally more efficient because the subquery is executed once. | Less efficient because the subquery is executed for each row of the outer query. |

## **Summary of Subqueries**

* **Subqueries** are nested queries that are used to perform operations on data from multiple tables and return results that will be used by the outer query.
* **Non-correlated subqueries** can be executed independently of the outer query. They are often used for comparison operations and return a single value or set of values.
* **Correlated subqueries** depend on the outer query and are executed for each row processed by the outer query. They are useful for comparing values row by row, such as when comparing an employee's salary to the average salary in their department.

Subqueries are a powerful feature in SQL, allowing you to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable queries.
