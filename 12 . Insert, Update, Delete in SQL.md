# **12. Insert, Update, Delete in SQL**

## **1. INSERT INTO Statement**

The **`INSERT INTO`** statement is used to insert new rows of data into a table.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

* **`table_name`**: The name of the table you want to insert data into.
* **`column1, column2, ...`**: The columns in the table you want to insert values into (optional if inserting data into all columns).
* **`value1, value2, ...`**: The values to insert into the respective columns.

## **Example 1: Inserting a Single Row**

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, salary, department_id)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000, 101);
```

* This inserts a new employee with `employee_id` 1, name **John Doe**, salary **50000**, and department **101** into the `employees` table.

## **Example 2: Inserting Multiple Rows**

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, salary, department_id)
VALUES
(2, 'Alice Smith', 60000, 102),
(3, 'Bob Johnson', 55000, 101),
(4, 'Carol Williams', 70000, 103);
```

* This inserts multiple rows at once into the `employees` table.

## **Note**: If you want to insert values into all columns of a table, you can omit the column names:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees
VALUES (5, 'David Brown', 65000, 102);
```

## **2. UPDATE Statement**

The **`UPDATE`** statement is used to modify existing data in a table. You can update one or more columns for specific rows, based on a condition defined in the `WHERE` clause.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

* **`table_name`**: The name of the table you want to update.
* **`column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...`**: The columns to update and their new values.
* **`condition`**: A condition that specifies which rows to update.

## **Example 1: Updating a Single Column**

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 55000
WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

* This updates the salary of the employee with `employee_id` 1 to `55000`.

## **Example 2: Updating Multiple Columns**

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 60000, department_id = 102
WHERE employee_id = 2;
```

* This updates both the salary and department of the employee with `employee_id` 2.

## **Example 3: Updating All Rows**

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 50000;
```

* This updates the salary of all employees to `50000`. **Be careful** when omitting the `WHERE` clause, as it will update every row in the table.

## **Note**: Always use the `WHERE` clause to specify which rows you want to update, unless you intend to update every row.

---

## **3. DELETE Statement**

The **`DELETE`** statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table. It can be used with or without a condition.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

* **`table_name`**: The name of the table from which you want to delete data.
* **`condition`**: The condition that specifies which rows to delete.

## **Example 1: Deleting a Single Row**

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 3;
```

* This deletes the employee with `employee_id` 3 from the `employees` table.

## **Example 2: Deleting Multiple Rows**

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 101;
```

* This deletes all employees who belong to the department with `department_id` 101.

## **Example 3: Deleting All Rows**

```sql
DELETE FROM employees;
```

* This deletes **all rows** from the `employees` table but does not remove the table itself.

## **Note**: Similar to the `UPDATE` statement, **be cautious** when using the `DELETE` statement without a `WHERE` clause. Omitting the `WHERE` clause will delete **all rows** in the table.

---

## **Important Considerations**

* **Transactions**: When performing **`INSERT`**, **`UPDATE`**, or **`DELETE`** operations, it's important to be aware of transactions. Most databases support transactions, which allow you to commit or roll back changes if something goes wrong.

  Example:

  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;

  UPDATE employees
  SET salary = 60000
  WHERE employee_id = 1;

  COMMIT;  -- Apply the changes
  ```

  If something goes wrong, you can use `ROLLBACK` to undo changes.

* **Data Integrity**: Use these statements carefully, especially with conditions. Improper use can lead to unintentional data loss (e.g., using `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause).

---

## **Summary**

* **INSERT INTO**: Used to add new rows to a table. You can insert one row or multiple rows at once.
* **UPDATE**: Used to modify existing data in a table. Always use a `WHERE` clause to specify which rows to update, unless you want to update all rows.
* **DELETE**: Used to delete rows from a table. Like `UPDATE`, always use a `WHERE` clause to prevent deleting all rows in a table.
