# **27. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**

## **1. What is a Common Table Expression (CTE)?**

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is a temporary result set defined within the execution scope of a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. CTEs make queries easier to read and maintain by breaking down complex queries into simpler, reusable parts.

CTEs can be thought of as a **named subquery** that you can reference multiple times in the main query. They improve the readability of SQL queries and allow for more complex logic without deeply nesting subqueries.

## **Syntax for Basic CTE**:

```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    -- CTE query (subquery)
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

* **`WITH`**: The keyword to define a CTE.
* **`cte_name`**: The name you assign to the CTE.
* The query inside the CTE acts as a temporary result set, which can be referred to in the outer query.

## **2. Recursive CTEs**

A **Recursive CTE** is a CTE that references itself in its definition. Recursive CTEs are commonly used for working with hierarchical or tree-structured data (e.g., organizational charts, bill-of-materials). Recursive CTEs consist of two parts:

1. **Base Case**: The initial query that defines the result set.
2. **Recursive Case**: The part that recursively references the CTE to produce subsequent rows.

## **Syntax for Recursive CTE**:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
    -- Base case: the initial query
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: the query that references the CTE
    SELECT t.column1, t.column2
    FROM table_name t
    JOIN cte_name c ON t.column = c.column
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

* **`UNION ALL`**: Combines the base case with the recursive case.
* The recursive part of the CTE references itself, which allows it to process data incrementally.

## **Example: Recursive CTE for Organizational Hierarchy**

Consider an `employees` table with the following structure:

| employee\_id | name  | manager\_id |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| 1            | Alice | NULL        |
| 2            | Bob   | 1           |
| 3            | Carol | 1           |
| 4            | David | 2           |
| 5            | Eve   | 3           |

To retrieve the hierarchical structure of employees (employee and their direct reports), we can use a recursive CTE.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: Get the top-level employees (those who have no manager)
    SELECT employee_id, name, manager_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: Get the employees who report to someone in the hierarchy
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.manager_id
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
```

## **Result**:

| employee\_id | name  | manager\_id |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| 1            | Alice | NULL        |
| 2            | Bob   | 1           |
| 3            | Carol | 1           |
| 4            | David | 2           |
| 5            | Eve   | 3           |

* This query will return the full hierarchy of employees, starting from the top-level managers (those with `NULL` as their `manager_id`) and recursively including their direct reports.

## **Key Points about Recursive CTEs**:

* Recursive CTEs are useful for **hierarchical data** (e.g., organization charts, categories with subcategories).
* They rely on the `UNION ALL` operation to repeatedly combine the base case with the recursive case.
* Always ensure that the recursion has an **exit condition** to prevent infinite loops.

## **3. Inline Views**

An **Inline View** is a subquery that is used in the `FROM` clause of a query. It's essentially a derived table that is available only for the duration of the query. Inline views allow you to **treat a subquery as a table** and can be used for more complex data manipulations.

## **Syntax for Inline View**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
) AS inline_view_alias;
```

* The **inline view** is defined as a subquery in the `FROM` clause.
* It is then treated as a temporary table, and you can use it in the main query.

## **Example: Using an Inline View to Aggregate Data**

Let's say you have an `orders` table, and you want to find the total sales per customer.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total) AS total_sales
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS customer_sales;
```

* The subquery (inline view) calculates the total sales per customer, and the outer query retrieves this aggregated data.

## **Key Points about Inline Views**:

* **Simplifies complex queries** by using intermediate results.
* Can be used for **aggregation**, **joins**, or **subqueries** that need to be treated as a table.

## **4. Using CTEs for Hierarchical Data**

In addition to **recursive CTEs**, non-recursive CTEs can also be helpful for working with hierarchical data. When you use **CTEs for hierarchical data**, you can create a series of **step-by-step transformations** to break down complex hierarchical structures and better analyze them.

## **Example: Using a CTE to Flatten a Hierarchical Structure**

Letâ€™s assume we have a table called `categories` representing a product hierarchy.

| category\_id | category\_name | parent\_category\_id |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------- |
| 1            | Electronics    | NULL                 |
| 2            | Laptops        | 1                    |
| 3            | Desktops       | 1                    |
| 4            | Phones         | 1                    |
| 5            | Gaming Laptops | 2                    |

We want to get a list of categories and their parent categories.

```sql
WITH category_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT category_id, category_name, parent_category_id
    FROM categories
    WHERE parent_category_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT c.category_id, c.category_name, c.parent_category_id
    FROM categories c
    JOIN category_hierarchy ch ON c.parent_category_id = ch.category_id
)
SELECT * FROM category_hierarchy;
```

## **Result**:

| category\_id | category\_name | parent\_category\_id |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------- |
| 1            | Electronics    | NULL                 |
| 2            | Laptops        | 1                    |
| 3            | Desktops       | 1                    |
| 4            | Phones         | 1                    |
| 5            | Gaming Laptops | 2                    |

* This query recursively flattens the hierarchical structure and returns all categories along with their parent categories.

## **Key Benefits of Using CTEs for Hierarchical Data**:

* **Recursive queries** help you traverse hierarchical relationships (e.g., organizational charts, bill-of-materials).
* CTEs simplify the process of working with recursive data and provide an easier-to-understand and maintainable approach than traditional recursive SQL queries.
