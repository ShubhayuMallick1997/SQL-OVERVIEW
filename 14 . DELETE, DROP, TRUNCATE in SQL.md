# **14. DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE in SQL**

## **1. DELETE Statement**

The **`DELETE`** statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table based on a **condition**. The condition is specified using the **`WHERE`** clause. **If no condition is provided, all rows are deleted**, but the table structure and its schema (columns, indexes, constraints) remain intact.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## **Example 1: Deleting Specific Rows**

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 3;
```

* This deletes the row where `employee_id` is `3` from the `employees` table.

## **Example 2: Deleting All Rows**

```sql
DELETE FROM employees;
```

* This deletes **all rows** from the `employees` table, but the table structure remains intact.

## **Key Points**:

* **Rows are deleted** based on a condition.
* **Triggers**: If there are any **triggers** set up on the table, they will be activated during a `DELETE` operation.
* **Rollback**: The `DELETE` operation can be rolled back if inside a **transaction**.
* **Slower** than `TRUNCATE` because it logs each row deletion.

## **2. DROP Statement**

The **`DROP`** statement is used to **completely remove** a table, a view, or another database object from the database. This operation **removes the entire table structure**, including all its data, indexes, constraints, and the table itself.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

## **Example 1: Dropping a Table**

```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```

* This deletes the `employees` table and all its associated data, indexes, and constraints from the database.

## **Key Points**:

* **Removes the entire table** (structure and data).
* **Cannot be rolled back** (unless using a transaction).
* **Frees up space** in the database as the table is completely removed.
* **No triggers** are fired during a `DROP`.

---

## **3. TRUNCATE Statement**

The **`TRUNCATE`** statement is used to **remove all rows from a table** quickly, but unlike `DELETE`, it does not log individual row deletions. It **only removes the data** and resets any **auto-incrementing columns** to their initial value. The **table structure** remains intact, including the columns, constraints, and indexes.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

## **Example 1: Truncating a Table**

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
```

* This deletes **all rows** from the `employees` table but retains the table structure.

## **Key Points**:

* **Removes all rows** from the table.
* **Cannot use WHERE clause**: `TRUNCATE` operates on the entire table and removes all rows.
* **Faster than DELETE**: Since it doesnâ€™t log individual row deletions, it is faster than `DELETE`.
* **No triggers** are fired (unlike `DELETE`).
* **Cannot be rolled back** in many database systems (unless inside a transaction in some RDBMS).
* **Resets auto-increment columns** back to their starting value (e.g., if the `employee_id` column is auto-incrementing, it resets to 1).

## **Comparison of DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE**

| **Operation** | **Deletes Rows or Table**          | **Deletes Data Only or Structure**   | **Resets Auto-increment** | **Can Be Rolled Back**    | **Triggers Activated** | **Performance**                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **DELETE**    | Rows based on condition            | Data only (table structure remains)  | No                        | Yes (if in a transaction) | Yes                    | Slower (row-by-row deletion)   |
| **DROP**      | Entire table (including structure) | Table and all its data and structure | No                        | No                        | No                     | Fast (table is removed)        |
| **TRUNCATE**  | All rows                           | Data only (table structure remains)  | Yes                       | No (in most RDBMS)        | No                     | Faster (no row-by-row logging) |

## **Summary**

* **`DELETE`**: Used to delete specific rows based on a condition. It retains the table structure and can be rolled back if inside a transaction. It is slower compared to `TRUNCATE`.
* **`DROP`**: Completely removes a table or another database object. It also removes the structure, indexes, and data. This operation cannot be rolled back unless inside a transaction.
* **`TRUNCATE`**: Quickly removes all rows from a table but keeps the table structure intact. It is faster than `DELETE` but cannot be rolled back in most RDBMS.

These statements are critical for managing and cleaning up data in a database, but they should be used carefully, especially in production environments, to avoid accidental data loss.
