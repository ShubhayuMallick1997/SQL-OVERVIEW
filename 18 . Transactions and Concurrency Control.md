# **18. Transactions and Concurrency Control**

## **1. ACID Properties**

The **ACID** properties are a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably and ensure data integrity. ACID stands for **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability**.

## **Atomicity**

* **Atomicity** ensures that a transaction is treated as a **single unit of work**. Either all the operations within a transaction are **completed successfully**, or none of them are. If a transaction fails in the middle, the changes are rolled back.

  **Example**: If you're transferring money between two bank accounts, the transaction will either complete entirely (money transferred from one account and added to the other) or nothing happens at all (if there's a failure, no money is moved).

## **Consistency**

* **Consistency** ensures that a transaction takes the database from one **valid state** to another. The database rules, constraints, and integrity checks (e.g., foreign keys, unique constraints) must be maintained throughout the transaction.

  **Example**: If a database enforces a constraint where no account balance can be negative, consistency ensures that a transaction will not allow an account balance to go below zero.

## **Isolation**

* **Isolation** ensures that the operations of one transaction are **isolated** from other transactions. Intermediate steps of a transaction should not be visible to other transactions. The final result of the transaction will be visible once the transaction is committed.

  **Example**: Two people transferring money from the same account at the same time should not result in a situation where the account goes below zero, even if both transactions are happening simultaneously.

## **Durability**

* **Durability** guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, its changes are **permanent**. Even if there’s a system crash after the commit, the changes will not be lost.

  **Example**: After completing a bank transfer, even if the system crashes, the transaction will persist when the system comes back up.

## **2. COMMIT and ROLLBACK**

## **COMMIT**

* **COMMIT** is used to **save all changes** made during the current transaction to the database permanently. Once a commit is issued, all changes made by the transaction are finalized and cannot be undone.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

## **Example**:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_id = 1;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 100
WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

* This example performs a money transfer between two accounts. If both updates are successful, the changes are committed to the database.

## **ROLLBACK**

* **ROLLBACK** is used to **undo** all changes made during the current transaction if something goes wrong. It restores the database to its state before the transaction started.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

## **Example**:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_id = 1;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 100
WHERE account_id = 2;

-- If an error occurs, rollback the transaction
ROLLBACK;
```

* If an error occurs between the two updates (e.g., insufficient funds in account 1), the `ROLLBACK` will undo all changes, and no money will be transferred.

---

## **3. SAVEPOINT**

A **SAVEPOINT** is used to set a point within a transaction to which you can later **rollback**. This allows partial rollback of the transaction rather than rolling back the entire transaction.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

## **Example 1: Using SAVEPOINT**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_id = 1;

SAVEPOINT transaction_point;  -- Set a savepoint

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 100
WHERE account_id = 2;

-- If something goes wrong, rollback to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO transaction_point;

COMMIT;
```

* In this example, if an error occurs after the first update, we can **rollback to the savepoint**, undoing only the second update without affecting the first one.

## **4. Isolation Levels**

Isolation levels control how transactions interact with each other and the **degree of visibility** of the data being modified. There are several isolation levels, each with different trade-offs between performance and consistency.

## **Isolation Levels**:

1. **Read Uncommitted**:

   * Transactions can **see uncommitted changes** made by other transactions. This is the **lowest isolation level**, meaning transactions can see dirty data (data that might later be rolled back).

   **Example**: One transaction reads data that another transaction is modifying, even if the second transaction is not yet committed.

   **Problems**:

   * **Dirty Reads**: Reading uncommitted data.
   * **Non-repeatable Reads**: Data that can change between two reads within the same transaction.

2. **Read Committed**:

   * A transaction can only **see committed data**. This ensures that a transaction does not read dirty data, but it still allows **non-repeatable reads**.

   **Example**: If you read a value and another transaction commits a change to that value, the next time you read the value, you get the new data.

   **Problems**:

   * **Non-repeatable Reads**: Data can change if read multiple times within the same transaction.

3. **Repeatable Read**:

   * Ensures that **all data reads** within a transaction are consistent. No other transaction can modify the data between two reads in the same transaction.

   **Example**: If you read a value, it will remain the same throughout the transaction, even if other transactions try to modify it.

   **Problems**:

   * **Phantom Reads**: New rows can appear in the result set between two reads within the same transaction.

4. **Serializable**:

   * The **highest isolation level**. Transactions are executed as if they were the only transaction in the system. No other transactions can access or modify the data until the current transaction is completed.

   **Example**: It guarantees no **dirty reads**, **non-repeatable reads**, or **phantom reads**.

   **Problems**:

   * **Performance**: This is the most restrictive isolation level and can significantly reduce concurrency because it locks the data for the duration of the transaction.

## **Summary of Isolation Levels**:

| **Isolation Level**  | **Dirty Reads** | **Non-repeatable Reads** | **Phantom Reads** | **Description**                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read Uncommitted** | Allowed         | Allowed                  | Allowed           | Lowest isolation level, can see uncommitted data.   |
| **Read Committed**   | Not Allowed     | Allowed                  | Allowed           | Only committed data can be read.                    |
| **Repeatable Read**  | Not Allowed     | Not Allowed              | Allowed           | Ensures repeated reads return the same value.       |
| **Serializable**     | Not Allowed     | Not Allowed              | Not Allowed       | Highest isolation level, provides full consistency. |

## **Summary**

* **ACID Properties** ensure reliable database transactions: **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability**.
* **COMMIT** finalizes a transaction, making changes permanent, while **ROLLBACK** undoes a transaction’s changes.
* **SAVEPOINT** allows rolling back part of a transaction without undoing the entire transaction.
* **Isolation Levels** control how transactions interact with each other, from **Read Uncommitted** (low performance, low consistency) to **Serializable** (high performance, high consistency).

These transaction and concurrency control concepts are essential for managing data integrity, consistency, and performance in multi-user environments. Let me know if you need further clarification or examples!
