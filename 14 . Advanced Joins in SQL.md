# **14. Advanced Joins in SQL**

## **1. Self Join**

A **Self Join** is a type of join where a table is **joined with itself**. It is useful when you need to compare rows within the same table, such as comparing employees with their managers or finding relationships between records in the same table.

To distinguish between the two instances of the same table, we use **aliases**.

## **Self Join Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT A.column1, B.column2
FROM table_name A
JOIN table_name B
ON A.column_name = B.column_name;
```

* Here, **`A`** and **`B`** are aliases for the same table.

## **Example 1: Employees and Managers**

Let's say we have an `employees` table where each employee has a `manager_id` pointing to their manager's `employee_id`. We can use a self join to find the employees and their managers.

**employees Table**:

| employee\_id | name  | manager\_id |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| 1            | John  | 2           |
| 2            | Alice | NULL        |
| 3            | Bob   | 2           |
| 4            | Carol | 3           |

```sql
SELECT E1.name AS employee_name, E2.name AS manager_name
FROM employees E1
LEFT JOIN employees E2
ON E1.manager_id = E2.employee_id;
```

## **Result**:

| employee\_name | manager\_name |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| John           | Alice         |
| Alice          | NULL          |
| Bob            | Alice         |
| Carol          | Bob           |

* Here, we are using the `LEFT JOIN` to join the `employees` table with itself. The `E1` alias represents the employee, and `E2` represents the manager.

## **2. CROSS JOIN**

A **CROSS JOIN** returns the **Cartesian product** of two tables. This means every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table. This join does not require a `ON` condition because it's essentially creating all possible combinations of the rows from both tables.

## **CROSS JOIN Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

## **Example 1: Cartesian Product of Employees and Departments**

Assume we have an `employees` table and a `departments` table.

**employees Table**:

| employee\_id | name  |
| ------------ | ----- |
| 1            | John  |
| 2            | Alice |
| 3            | Bob   |

**departments Table**:

| department\_id | department\_name |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 101            | HR               |
| 102            | IT               |

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

## **Result**:

| name  | department\_name |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| John  | HR               |
| John  | IT               |
| Alice | HR               |
| Alice | IT               |
| Bob   | HR               |
| Bob   | IT               |

* This query returns every possible combination of employees and departments. Since we have 3 employees and 2 departments, the result is a total of 6 rows.

## **Key Points about CROSS JOIN**:

* **No filtering or condition** is applied.
* The number of rows in the result will be the product of the rows in both tables. For example, if **Table1** has `m` rows and **Table2** has `n` rows, the result will have `m * n` rows.

## **3. NATURAL JOIN**

A **NATURAL JOIN** automatically joins two tables based on all columns with the **same name** in both tables. It removes the need for explicitly specifying the join condition (i.e., using `ON` or `USING`).

## **NATURAL JOIN Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
NATURAL JOIN table2;
```

## **Example 1: Joining Employees and Departments by Common Column**

Assume we have two tables: `employees` and `departments`, both containing a `department_id` column.

**employees Table**:

| employee\_id | name  | department\_id |
| ------------ | ----- | -------------- |
| 1            | John  | 101            |
| 2            | Alice | 102            |
| 3            | Bob   | 101            |

**departments Table**:

| department\_id | department\_name |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 101            | HR               |
| 102            | IT               |

```sql
SELECT name, department_name
FROM employees
NATURAL JOIN departments;
```

## **Result**:

| name  | department\_name |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| John  | HR               |
| Alice | IT               |
| Bob   | HR               |

* The `NATURAL JOIN` automatically joins the tables on the `department_id` column because it is present in both tables.

## **Key Points about NATURAL JOIN**:

* Automatically joins tables using all columns that have the **same name** in both tables.
* Can lead to ambiguity if multiple columns have the same name in both tables.
* In some cases, it may be less flexible than explicit joins because you cannot control which columns are used for the join.

## **Comparison of JOIN Types**

| **Join Type**    | **Description**                                                                                                             | **Use Case**                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self Join**    | A table is joined with itself, often using aliases to compare rows within the same table.                                   | When comparing rows in the same table, e.g., employees and their managers.                                       |
| **CROSS JOIN**   | Returns the Cartesian product of two tables, combining every row from the first table with every row from the second table. | When you need all combinations of rows from two tables, such as creating combinations of products and stores.    |
| **NATURAL JOIN** | Automatically joins tables based on columns with the same name.                                                             | When you want a quick join based on common column names and donâ€™t need explicit control over the join condition. |

## **Summary**

* **Self Join**: Useful for comparing rows in the same table, like employees and their managers. It requires aliases to differentiate between the two instances of the same table.
* **CROSS JOIN**: Creates the Cartesian product of two tables, resulting in all combinations of rows from both tables. Use it when you need all possible combinations.
* **NATURAL JOIN**: Automatically joins tables based on columns with the same name. It simplifies joins, but be cautious as it might not give you the flexibility you need if multiple columns share the same name.

These advanced joins are great tools for solving complex queries that require relationships within or between tables. Let me know if you need more examples or clarification!
