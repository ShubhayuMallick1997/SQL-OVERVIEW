# **7. Basic Joins in SQL**

## **1. INNER JOIN**

An **INNER JOIN** returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. If there is no match between the tables, those rows will be excluded from the result set. This is the most commonly used type of join.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

## **Example**: Inner Join between `employees` and `departments` tables

```sql
SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

* This will return the **name** and **salary** of employees along with their **department name** only for employees who have a matching department in the `departments` table.

## **Key Points**:

* Returns **only matching rows** from both tables.
* If a row in one table has no matching row in the other table, it is excluded.

---

## **2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**

A **LEFT JOIN** (or **LEFT OUTER JOIN**) returns all the rows from the **left table** (table1), and the matching rows from the **right table** (table2). If there is no match, the result is `NULL` on the side of the right table.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

## **Example**: Left Join between `employees` and `departments` tables

```sql
SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

* This will return all employees' names and salaries along with their department names. If an employee doesn't belong to a department, the `department_name` will be `NULL`.

## **Key Points**:

* Returns all rows from the **left table**.
* If no matching row exists in the **right table**, `NULL` is returned for columns from the right table.

---

## **3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**

A **RIGHT JOIN** (or **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**) is similar to the **LEFT JOIN**, but it returns all rows from the **right table** (table2), and the matching rows from the **left table** (table1). If there is no match, the result is `NULL` on the side of the left table.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

## **Example**: Right Join between `employees` and `departments` tables

```sql
SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

* This will return all department names from the `departments` table, and if any department has no employees, the employee details will be `NULL`.

## **Key Points**:

* Returns all rows from the **right table**.
* If no matching row exists in the **left table**, `NULL` is returned for columns from the left table.

---

## **4. FULL OUTER JOIN**

A **FULL OUTER JOIN** returns all rows when there is a **match** in either the **left** or the **right table**. If there is no match, the missing side will contain `NULL`.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

## **Example**: Full Outer Join between `employees` and `departments` tables

```sql
SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

* This will return all employees, all departments, and their corresponding data. If an employee doesn't belong to a department, or a department has no employees, `NULL` values will be shown for the missing data.

## **Key Points**:

* Returns all rows from both the **left** and **right tables**.
* If there is no match, `NULL` is returned for columns from the table with no matching row.

## **Comparison of Joins**

| **Join Type**       | **Returns**                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **INNER JOIN**      | Only matching rows from both tables                                                                                     |
| **LEFT JOIN**       | All rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table, or `NULL` for unmatched rows from the right table |
| **RIGHT JOIN**      | All rows from the right table, and matching rows from the left table, or `NULL` for unmatched rows from the left table  |
| **FULL OUTER JOIN** | All rows from both tables, with `NULL` for unmatched rows from both tables                                              |

## **Examples with Data**

Let's assume we have the following two tables:

**employees Table**:

| employee\_id | name  | salary | department\_id |
| ------------ | ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| 1            | John  | 50000  | 101            |
| 2            | Alice | 60000  | 102            |
| 3            | Bob   | 55000  | NULL           |

**departments Table**:

| department\_id | department\_name |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 101            | HR               |
| 102            | IT               |
| 103            | Finance          |

## **INNER JOIN Example**:

```sql
SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

* Result:

  | name  | salary | department\_name |
  | ----- | ------ | ---------------- |
  | John  | 50000  | HR               |
  | Alice | 60000  | IT               |

## **LEFT JOIN Example**:

```sql
SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

* Result:

  | name  | salary | department\_name |
  | ----- | ------ | ---------------- |
  | John  | 50000  | HR               |
  | Alice | 60000  | IT               |
  | Bob   | 55000  | NULL             |

## **RIGHT JOIN Example**:

```sql
SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

* Result:

  | name  | salary | department\_name |
  | ----- | ------ | ---------------- |
  | John  | 50000  | HR               |
  | Alice | 60000  | IT               |
  | NULL  | NULL   | Finance          |

## **FULL OUTER JOIN Example**:

```sql
SELECT employees.name, employees.salary, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

* Result:

  | name  | salary | department\_name |
  | ----- | ------ | ---------------- |
  | John  | 50000  | HR               |
  | Alice | 60000  | IT               |
  | Bob   | 55000  | NULL             |
  | NULL  | NULL   | Finance          |

## **Summary of Joins**

* **INNER JOIN**: Returns only the rows where there is a match between both tables.
* **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table; if no match, `NULL` is returned for the right table columns.
* **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table; if no match, `NULL` is returned for the left table columns.
* **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all rows from both tables; `NULL` is returned for unmatched rows from both tables.

These joins are essential for retrieving data that spans across multiple tables, allowing you to create more complex and meaningful queries.
