# **11. Group By and Having Clause**

## **1. GROUP BY Clause**

The **`GROUP BY`** clause is used in SQL to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data. It's often used with aggregate functions like **COUNT()**, **SUM()**, **AVG()**, **MIN()**, and **MAX()** to return summary results for each group.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

* `column1`: The column by which you want to group the data.
* `aggregate_function`: Functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, etc.

## **Example 1: GROUP BY with COUNT()**

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

* This will return the total number of employees in each department.

## **Example 2: GROUP BY with SUM()**

```sql
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

* This will return the total salary cost for each department.

## **Example 3: GROUP BY with AVG()**

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

* This will return the average salary in each department.

## **Example 4: GROUP BY with Multiple Columns**

You can group by multiple columns as well:

```sql
SELECT department_id, job_title, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id, job_title;
```

* This will return the total number of employees for each combination of department and job title.

## **2. HAVING Clause for Filtering Groups**

The **`HAVING`** clause is used to filter results **after** the aggregation is done by the **`GROUP BY`** clause. Unlike the **`WHERE`** clause, which filters individual rows before aggregation, **`HAVING`** filters groups that are formed after the aggregation.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;
```

* The condition in the `HAVING` clause is applied to the aggregated result.

## **Example 1: Using HAVING with COUNT()**

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

* This will return only departments with more than 5 employees.

## **Example 2: Using HAVING with SUM()**

```sql
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING SUM(salary) > 100000;
```

* This will return departments where the total salary exceeds `100,000`.

## **Example 3: Using HAVING with AVG()**

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) < 60000;
```

* This will return departments where the average salary is less than `60,000`.

## **Example 4: Using HAVING with Multiple Conditions**

You can also combine conditions in the `HAVING` clause using **AND** or **OR**.

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(salary) < 60000;
```

* This will return departments with more than 5 employees and where the average salary is less than `60,000`.

## **Comparison Between WHERE and HAVING**

* **WHERE Clause**: Filters rows before aggregation. It is used to filter individual records before the `GROUP BY` operation.
* **HAVING Clause**: Filters groups after aggregation. It is used to filter aggregated data after the `GROUP BY` operation.

For example:

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30
GROUP BY department_id;
```

* The `WHERE` clause filters employees older than 30 before the aggregation.

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

* The `HAVING` clause filters groups where the number of employees is greater than 5 after the aggregation.

---

## **Summary**

* **`GROUP BY`**: Groups rows based on a specified column or columns, and allows you to perform aggregate functions on each group.
* **`HAVING`**: Filters groups after aggregation, allowing you to apply conditions to the result of the `GROUP BY` clause. It is often used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.

The **`WHERE`** clause is used for filtering rows before aggregation, while the **`HAVING`** clause is used to filter groups after aggregation.
