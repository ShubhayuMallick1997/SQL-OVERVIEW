# **6. SQL Functions**

## **1. Aggregate Functions**

**Aggregate functions** perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single result. These are often used with the `GROUP BY` clause to perform calculations on groups of rows.

## **Common Aggregate Functions**:

* **COUNT()**: Returns the number of rows in a set.
* **SUM()**: Returns the sum of a numeric column.
* **AVG()**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
* **MIN()**: Returns the minimum value in a column.
* **MAX()**: Returns the maximum value in a column.

## **Example 1: COUNT()**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the total number of employees in the `employees` table.

## **Example 2: SUM()**

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salaries
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the sum of all employee salaries.

## **Example 3: AVG()**

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the average salary of all employees.

## **Example 4: MIN() and MAX()**

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the minimum and maximum salaries in the `employees` table.

## **Example 5: Using Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY**

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

* This will return the number of employees and the average salary for each department.

## **2. String Functions**

**String functions** allow you to manipulate string data in SQL. These are used to process text values, such as concatenating strings, changing case, and determining string lengths.

## **Common String Functions**:

* **CONCAT()**: Concatenates two or more strings together.
* **LENGTH()**: Returns the length of a string.
* **LOWER()**: Converts a string to lowercase.
* **UPPER()**: Converts a string to uppercase.

## **Example 1: CONCAT()**

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the full name of employees by concatenating their `first_name` and `last_name` columns.

## **Example 2: LENGTH()**

```sql
SELECT name, LENGTH(name) AS name_length
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the length of each employee's name.

## **Example 3: LOWER() and UPPER()**

```sql
SELECT LOWER(first_name) AS lowercase_first_name, UPPER(last_name) AS uppercase_last_name
FROM employees;
```

* This will convert `first_name` to lowercase and `last_name` to uppercase.

## **3. Date Functions**

**Date functions** allow you to manipulate and extract parts of date and time data in SQL. These are commonly used to filter or display data based on time intervals.

## **Common Date Functions**:

* **NOW()**: Returns the current date and time.
* **DATEPART()**: Extracts a part of a date (e.g., year, month, day).
* **DATEADD()**: Adds or subtracts a specified time interval to a date.

## **Example 1: NOW()**

```sql
SELECT NOW() AS current_date_time;
```

* This will return the current date and time of the database server.

## **Example 2: DATEPART()**

```sql
SELECT DATEPART(year, hire_date) AS hire_year
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the year part of the `hire_date` for each employee.

## **Example 3: DATEADD()**

```sql
SELECT DATEADD(year, 1, hire_date) AS one_year_later
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the date one year after each employee's `hire_date`.

## **4. Mathematical Functions**

**Mathematical functions** allow you to perform calculations on numeric data. These functions are useful for rounding numbers, calculating floors and ceilings, and other numeric manipulations.

## **Common Mathematical Functions**:

* **ROUND()**: Rounds a number to a specified decimal point.
* **FLOOR()**: Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number.
* **CEIL()**: Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number.

## **Example 1: ROUND()**

```sql
SELECT ROUND(salary, 2) AS rounded_salary
FROM employees;
```

* This will round the `salary` column to two decimal places.

## **Example 2: FLOOR()**

```sql
SELECT FLOOR(salary) AS salary_floor
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the greatest integer less than or equal to each employee's salary.

## **Example 3: CEIL()**

```sql
SELECT CEIL(salary) AS salary_ceil
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the smallest integer greater than or equal to each employee's salary.

## **Summary of SQL Functions**

* **Aggregate Functions**: Perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single value (e.g., `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`).
* **String Functions**: Allow manipulation of string data (e.g., `CONCAT()`, `LENGTH()`, `LOWER()`, `UPPER()`).
* **Date Functions**: Work with date and time data (e.g., `NOW()`, `DATEPART()`, `DATEADD()`).
* **Mathematical Functions**: Perform mathematical operations (e.g., `ROUND()`, `FLOOR()`, `CEIL()`).

These functions are essential tools in SQL for transforming, filtering, and analyzing your data. They make it easier to manipulate and derive insights from your database.
