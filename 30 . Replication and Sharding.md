# **30. Replication and Sharding**

## **1. Master-Slave Replication**

**Master-Slave Replication** (also known as **Primary-Secondary Replication**) is a method used in database systems to create copies of the database for **scalability**, **redundancy**, and **high availability**. In this setup, one database server is designated as the **master** (primary), and other database servers are designated as **slaves** (secondary).

## **How It Works**:

* **Master**: The master server is the authoritative source of data. All write operations (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) happen on the master.
* **Slaves**: The slave servers replicate the data from the master. They receive **read-only copies** of the master database. This replication can be synchronous or asynchronous, depending on how the system is configured.

## **Advantages**:

* **Scalability**: By directing read queries to slave databases, the system can handle more queries, as the master is not overwhelmed by read traffic.
* **Redundancy**: Slaves act as backups for the master database, providing data redundancy and high availability.
* **Fault Tolerance**: If the master server fails, one of the slaves can be promoted to the master role, providing failover and ensuring system availability.

## **Example**: Replication in MySQL

* You can configure replication by setting up one server as the master and others as slaves. The slaves will replicate data from the master using **binary logs**.
* **Master configuration**:

  ```ini
  server-id = 1
  log-bin = mysql-bin
  ```
* **Slave configuration**:

  ```ini
  server-id = 2
  relay-log = mysql-relay-bin
  read-only = 1
  ```
* After setting up the configuration, the slave connects to the master and starts receiving updates.

## **Disadvantages**:

* **Write Bottleneck**: All write operations occur on the master, which can become a bottleneck.
* **Replication Lag**: In asynchronous replication, there may be some delay between the master and the slaves, meaning slaves may not reflect the most recent data immediately.

## **2. Database Sharding and Partitioning**

**Sharding** and **Partitioning** are techniques used to horizontally split data across multiple databases or servers, making it possible to handle large volumes of data and traffic.

## **Sharding**:

* **Sharding** refers to dividing a large dataset into smaller, more manageable pieces called **shards**. Each shard is stored on a separate database or server.
* **Shards** can be distributed across multiple physical machines, allowing the database system to scale horizontally and handle large amounts of traffic.

## **How Sharding Works**:

* **Shard Key**: Data is split based on a **shard key** (e.g., `customer_id`, `region`, `date`). Each shard holds a subset of the data based on the shard key.
* **Data Distribution**: Shards are distributed across multiple servers. This can be done manually (with a specific partitioning strategy) or automatically by a sharding framework.

## **Types of Sharding**:

1. **Range-based Sharding**: Data is divided into ranges based on the shard key. For example, customers with IDs from 1-1000 are in one shard, 1001-2000 in another.

   * **Example**: If you're sharding based on `customer_id`, customers 1-1000 go to shard 1, customers 1001-2000 go to shard 2, and so on.

2. **Hash-based Sharding**: A hash function is applied to the shard key, and data is distributed across shards based on the hash value. This is often used when the data cannot be easily divided into ranges.

3. **Directory-based Sharding**: A central directory stores metadata about where each data shard is located. This allows for flexible sharding but requires managing the directory.

## **Advantages of Sharding**:

* **Horizontal Scalability**: Sharding allows you to scale horizontally by adding more servers, distributing the load.
* **Improved Performance**: Sharding reduces the load on individual servers, improving response times.
* **Fault Isolation**: If one shard goes down, the others can still function, reducing the impact of failures.

## **Disadvantages of Sharding**:

* **Complexity**: Managing a sharded database can be complex, as queries may need to access multiple shards.
* **Cross-Shard Joins**: Performing joins across shards can be complicated and inefficient.
* **Rebalancing**: As data grows, you may need to **rebalance** shards, which can be challenging and time-consuming.

## **3. Data Consistency in Distributed Systems**

In distributed systems, **data consistency** refers to the correctness of data across all nodes in the system. Achieving strong consistency in a distributed database system can be challenging due to network partitions, node failures, and latency.

## **Consistency Models**:

1. **Strong Consistency**: All reads return the most recent write, and every read reflects the latest committed data.

   * **Example**: If you update a value on one node, all other nodes will reflect this value immediately.

2. **Eventual Consistency**: Data changes will propagate to all nodes eventually, but not necessarily immediately.

   * **Example**: In a system using eventual consistency, itâ€™s possible for some nodes to have stale data temporarily.

3. **Causal Consistency**: Ensures that the order of causally related operations is preserved. If one operation causes another, the system ensures that they are seen in that order.

   * **Example**: If a user sends a message, and the system then updates the message status to "delivered," it ensures that the "delivered" status appears only after the message.

4. **Consistency Levels** in **CAP Theorem**:

   * **CAP Theorem** states that a distributed system can only guarantee at most two out of the three properties:

     * **Consistency**: All nodes have the same data at any given time.
     * **Availability**: Every request will receive a response (even if some nodes are down).
     * **Partition Tolerance**: The system can function despite network partitions.

   Depending on the **trade-off** between these properties, you can choose different consistency levels, such as:

   * **Read Committed**
   * **Serializable**
   * **Eventual Consistency**
   * **Linearizability**

## **Ensuring Data Consistency**:

* **Replication**: Replication techniques (like **master-slave replication**) can improve availability but may sacrifice strong consistency. Using **synchronous replication** can help maintain consistency at the cost of performance.
* **Quorum-based Approaches**: In distributed systems like **Cassandra** or **HBase**, a **quorum** is used to ensure consistency. For example, a write might require a majority of nodes to acknowledge it before being considered committed.

## **Eventual Consistency in NoSQL Databases**:

* Many NoSQL databases (e.g., **Cassandra**, **Amazon DynamoDB**) favor **eventual consistency** to achieve high availability and partition tolerance, especially in distributed systems that span multiple regions or data centers.
