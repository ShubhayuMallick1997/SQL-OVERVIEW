# **17. Indexes in SQL**

## **1. What is an Index?**

An **index** is a **database object** that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional space and increased maintenance overhead during data modification (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Indexes are created on columns to speed up queries that search for specific values in those columns.

Think of an index like the **index of a book**: rather than reading through the entire book to find a topic, you can quickly look up the topic in the index and jump directly to the relevant page. Similarly, an index allows the database engine to quickly locate rows that match the search condition.

## **2. Creating Indexes**

To create an index on a column (or columns) in a table, you use the **CREATE INDEX** statement.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```

* **`index_name`**: The name you want to assign to the index.
* **`table_name`**: The name of the table where the index will be created.
* **`column1, column2, ...`**: The columns on which the index will be created.

## **Example 1: Creating a Simple Index**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name
ON employees (name);
```

* This creates an index named `idx_employee_name` on the `name` column of the `employees` table. This index will speed up queries that search for employee names.

## **Example 2: Creating a Composite Index (Multiple Columns)**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name_salary
ON employees (name, salary);
```

* This creates a composite index on the `name` and `salary` columns. It is useful for queries that filter on both columns simultaneously.

## **Example 3: Creating a Unique Index**

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_employee_id
ON employees (employee_id);
```

* This creates a unique index, ensuring that the values in the `employee_id` column are unique across the table. This also enforces the **uniqueness constraint**.

---

## **3. Unique vs Non-Unique Indexes**

## **Unique Indexes**:

* A **unique index** ensures that the values in the indexed columns are **unique**. No two rows in the table can have the same value for the indexed column(s).
* When you create a **unique index**, the database automatically enforces a **uniqueness constraint**.

## **Example**:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email
ON customers (email);
```

* This ensures that the `email` column in the `customers` table contains unique email addresses.

## **Non-Unique Indexes**:

* A **non-unique index** does not enforce any uniqueness on the indexed column(s). It is simply used to speed up query performance without affecting the data's uniqueness.

## **Example**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_non_unique_department
ON employees (department_id);
```

* This index will improve query performance for queries that filter or join based on the `department_id` column, but it does not enforce any uniqueness on the values in that column.

## **4. Indexing and Performance Optimization**

Indexes are primarily used to **optimize query performance** by speeding up data retrieval. However, while indexes significantly improve read operations, they also add overhead for write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), as the index must be updated whenever the data changes.

## **Benefits of Indexing**:

* **Faster Search**: Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval, especially when filtering or joining tables on indexed columns.
* **Faster Sorting**: Indexes can speed up the `ORDER BY` clause, as the database can use the index to sort data quickly.
* **Efficient Joins**: Indexes can speed up join operations between tables, as the database can use the index to find matching rows faster.

## **Example 1: Speeding Up Search**

Without an index, searching for an employee by name might require scanning every row in the `employees` table:

```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE name = 'John';
```

With an index on `name`, the query can use the index to find `John` much faster, reducing the need for a full table scan.

## **Example 2: Speeding Up JOINs**

If you're joining two tables (e.g., `employees` and `departments`), an index on the `department_id` column can significantly speed up the operation:

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

If both `employees.department_id` and `departments.department_id` have indexes, the join will be much faster.

## **Downsides of Indexing**:

* **Slower writes**: Every time data is inserted, updated, or deleted, the index must be updated, which can slow down write operations.
* **Storage**: Indexes take up additional space in the database.

## **5. Clustered vs Non-Clustered Indexes**

## **Clustered Indexes**:

* A **clustered index** determines the physical order of the rows in the table. There can only be **one clustered index** per table because the rows can only be sorted in one order.
* The data is **stored in the order** of the clustered index. This is particularly useful for range queries, as the data is stored contiguously.
* By default, the **primary key** of a table is a clustered index (unless explicitly defined otherwise).

## **Syntax** (for creating a clustered index, though it's generally created by default with the primary key):

```sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_clustered_employee_id
ON employees (employee_id);
```

## **Example of Clustered Index**:

```sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_employee_name
ON employees (name);
```

* This will physically reorder the rows in the `employees` table by the `name` column.

## **Non-Clustered Indexes**:

* A **non-clustered index** is an index where the logical order of the rows in the index is different from the physical order of the rows in the table. The index contains pointers to the actual data.
* A table can have multiple **non-clustered indexes** (unlike clustered indexes, where only one is allowed).

## **Syntax**:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_nonclustered_name
ON employees (name);
```

## **Key Differences Between Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes**:

| **Feature**                       | **Clustered Index**                                                 | **Non-Clustered Index**                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data storage**                  | Rows are stored in the order of the index                           | Rows are not stored in index order                                   |
| **Number of indexes**             | One per table (since it sorts the data)                             | Multiple indexes can exist on a table                                |
| **Performance for range queries** | Faster for range-based queries (data is sorted)                     | Slower for range-based queries                                       |
| **Use case**                      | When data retrieval needs to be ordered or ranges are often queried | When fast searches on columns without affecting row order are needed |

## **Summary of Index Types**

* **Clustered Index**: Organizes the table's data physically in the order of the index. A table can have only **one** clustered index.
* **Non-clustered Index**: A separate structure that contains pointers to the data in the table. A table can have **multiple** non-clustered indexes.

---

## **Summary of Key Points**

* **Creating Indexes**: You can create indexes on one or more columns to speed up searches and joins.
* **Unique vs Non-Unique Indexes**: Unique indexes enforce uniqueness on a column, while non-unique indexes donâ€™t.
* **Indexing and Performance Optimization**: Indexes speed up **read** operations but can slow down **write** operations.
* **Clustered vs Non-Clustered Indexes**: Clustered indexes affect the physical order of rows in a table, while non-clustered indexes are separate structures with pointers to the actual data.

Indexes are a powerful tool to optimize performance, but should be used wisely, especially in write-heavy applications, as they come with overhead costs.
