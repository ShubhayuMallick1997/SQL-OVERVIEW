# **15. Set Operations in SQL**

## **1. UNION and UNION ALL**

Both **`UNION`** and **`UNION ALL`** combine the results of two or more queries into a single result set, but they differ in how they handle duplicate rows.

## **UNION**

* **`UNION`** combines the result sets of two or more queries and **removes duplicate rows** from the final result set.
* The number and order of columns must be the same in all queries combined by `UNION`.
* It performs an **implicit DISTINCT** operation to eliminate duplicates.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

## **Example 1: Using UNION**

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```

* This will return all unique `name` values from both the `employees` and `contractors` tables, eliminating any duplicates.

## **Key Points**:

* **Duplicates are removed**.
* **Slower** than `UNION ALL` because it has to check for duplicates.

## **UNION ALL**

* **`UNION ALL`** combines the result sets of two or more queries and **does not remove duplicates**. It returns all rows from each query, including duplicates.
* This is generally faster than `UNION` because no deduplication is performed.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

## **Example 2: Using UNION ALL**

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```

* This will return all `name` values from both the `employees` and `contractors` tables, **including duplicates**.

## **Key Points**:

* **Duplicates are not removed**.
* **Faster** than `UNION` since no deduplication is required.

## **2. INTERSECT**

The **`INTERSECT`** operator returns the **common rows** between two result sets. It only includes the rows that appear in **both** queries.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

## **Example**: Find names that appear in both `employees` and `contractors` tables.

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
INTERSECT
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```

* This will return the `name` values that appear in **both** the `employees` and `contractors` tables.

## **Key Points**:

* Returns only the **common rows**.
* **Removes duplicates**: Like `UNION`, `INTERSECT` automatically eliminates duplicates from the result set.

---

## **3. EXCEPT (or MINUS)**

The **`EXCEPT`** operator (also known as **`MINUS`** in some database systems like Oracle) returns the rows from the first query that do not exist in the second query.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

## **Example 1: Using EXCEPT**

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
EXCEPT
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```

* This will return the `name` values from the `employees` table that **do not appear** in the `contractors` table.

## **Example 2: Using MINUS (in some systems)**

In Oracle, **`MINUS`** is used instead of `EXCEPT`:

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
MINUS
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```

* This will achieve the same result as `EXCEPT`, returning the names in `employees` that are not in `contractors`.

## **Key Points**:

* Returns the rows from the first query that **do not appear** in the second query.
* **Removes duplicates** in the result set.

## **Comparison of Set Operations**

| **Set Operation**  | **Description**                                                   | **Duplicates** | **Performance**                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **UNION**          | Combines results of two queries, removing duplicates.             | Removes        | Slower (due to deduplication)               |
| **UNION ALL**      | Combines results of two queries, including duplicates.            | Keeps          | Faster (no deduplication)                   |
| **INTERSECT**      | Returns only rows common to both queries.                         | Removes        | Slower (because it checks for common rows)  |
| **EXCEPT (MINUS)** | Returns rows in the first query that are not in the second query. | Removes        | Slower (since it compares both result sets) |

---

## **Summary**

* **`UNION`**: Combines results from two queries and removes duplicates.
* **`UNION ALL`**: Combines results from two queries and keeps duplicates.
* **`INTERSECT`**: Returns only rows that are present in both queries.
* **`EXCEPT` (or `MINUS` in some systems)**: Returns rows from the first query that do not appear in the second query.

Set operations are useful when you need to work with multiple result sets and combine them in different ways. Choose the right operation based on whether you need to keep or eliminate duplicates and based on the performance considerations.
