# **16. Normalization and Denormalization**

## **1. Normalization**

**Normalization** is the process of organizing the attributes (columns) and relations (tables) of a database to minimize redundancy and dependency. The goal is to ensure that the database is free of anomalies, which could lead to inconsistent data. It involves dividing a database into smaller, manageable tables and using relationships to connect them.

Normalization involves breaking down a table into multiple related tables to eliminate redundancy. It is usually done in stages, and each stage is called a **normal form**.

## **2. First Normal Form (1NF)**

A table is in **First Normal Form (1NF)** if:

* All the columns contain **atomic values** (i.e., indivisible values). Each cell should hold a single value, not a set or list of values.
* Each column contains **unique values** for each record.
* The order in which data is stored does not matter.

## **Example**: Table in 1NF

**Before 1NF**:

| student\_id | name  | subjects         |
| ----------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| 1           | John  | Math, Science    |
| 2           | Alice | English, History |

**After 1NF**:

| student\_id | name  | subject |
| ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| 1           | John  | Math    |
| 1           | John  | Science |
| 2           | Alice | English |
| 2           | Alice | History |

* In the **Before 1NF** table, the `subjects` column contains multiple values (Math, Science), which violates 1NF. In the **After 1NF** table, each subject is stored in a separate row, making each column atomic.

---

## **3. Second Normal Form (2NF)**

A table is in **Second Normal Form (2NF)** if:

* It is in **1NF**.
* It has **no partial dependencies**. This means that non-key attributes must depend on the **entire primary key** (not just part of it), i.e., each non-key attribute should be fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

## **Example**: Table in 2NF

**Before 2NF** (Partial dependency exists):

| student\_id | subject | teacher   | grade |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- | ----- |
| 1           | Math    | Mr. Smith | A     |
| 1           | Science | Mrs. Lee  | B     |
| 2           | English | Mr. Brown | A     |

* The primary key here is `student_id` and `subject`. However, the `teacher` column depends only on `subject`, not the full primary key (`student_id`, `subject`).

**After 2NF**:
We break the table into two:

1. **students\_subjects** table:

   | student\_id | subject | grade |
   | ----------- | ------- | ----- |
   | 1           | Math    | A     |
   | 1           | Science | B     |
   | 2           | English | A     |

2. **subjects\_teachers** table:

   | subject | teacher   |
   | ------- | --------- |
   | Math    | Mr. Smith |
   | Science | Mrs. Lee  |
   | English | Mr. Brown |

* In the **After 2NF** tables, `teacher` is placed in a separate table (`subjects_teachers`), eliminating the partial dependency.

---

## **4. Third Normal Form (3NF)**

A table is in **Third Normal Form (3NF)** if:

* It is in **2NF**.
* It has **no transitive dependencies**. This means non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes.

## **Example**: Table in 3NF

**Before 3NF** (Transitive dependency exists):

| student\_id | subject | grade | teacher   | department |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| 1           | Math    | A     | Mr. Smith | Science    |
| 2           | English | B     | Mr. Brown | Arts       |

* In the above table, the `department` depends on `teacher`, which is a non-key attribute. This is a transitive dependency (i.e., `student_id` → `teacher` → `department`).

**After 3NF**:

1. **students\_subjects** table:

   | student\_id | subject | grade |
   | ----------- | ------- | ----- |
   | 1           | Math    | A     |
   | 2           | English | B     |

2. **subjects\_teachers** table:

   | subject | teacher   | department |
   | ------- | --------- | ---------- |
   | Math    | Mr. Smith | Science    |
   | English | Mr. Brown | Arts       |

* By separating the `department` column into the `subjects_teachers` table, we remove the transitive dependency.

---

## **5. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

A table is in **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** if:

* It is in **3NF**.
* Every **determinant** is a **candidate key**. A determinant is any column or set of columns that can uniquely identify a row in a table.

## **Example**: Table in BCNF

**Before BCNF** (Non-candidate key dependency):

| student\_id | subject | instructor | room\_number |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Math    | Mr. Smith  | 101          |
| 2           | Science | Mrs. Lee   | 102          |

* In this case, `room_number` is determined by `subject`, not the `student_id` or the entire primary key (`student_id`, `subject`). This violates BCNF.

**After BCNF**:

1. **students\_subjects** table:

   | student\_id | subject |
   | ----------- | ------- |
   | 1           | Math    |
   | 2           | Science |

2. **subjects\_rooms** table:

   | subject | instructor | room\_number |
   | ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
   | Math    | Mr. Smith  | 101          |
   | Science | Mrs. Lee   | 102          |

* The `subjects_rooms` table is now in BCNF, as all columns that determine other values (e.g., `subject` determines `room_number`) are part of the candidate key.

## **6. Denormalization and its Use Cases**

**Denormalization** is the process of **introducing redundancy** into a database by merging tables or adding duplicate data. It is the opposite of normalization, and it can be used to improve performance, especially in cases where reading data is more frequent than writing.

## **Use Cases for Denormalization**:

1. **Performance Optimization**: In complex databases with many joins, denormalization can help improve read performance by reducing the need for multiple joins.
2. **Reporting and Analytics**: Denormalization is useful in data warehousing and reporting, where the focus is on fast querying and reporting rather than data integrity.
3. **Simplifying Queries**: By storing redundant data, complex queries can be simplified, making them easier to write and execute.

## **Example**: Combining two tables, `orders` and `products`, into a single table for quicker access:

* Instead of joining `orders` and `products` each time a query is executed, you could **denormalize** by storing product details directly in the `orders` table.

| order\_id | product\_id | product\_name | quantity | price |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ----- |
| 101       | 1           | Laptop        | 1        | 1000  |
| 102       | 2           | Phone         | 2        | 500   |

* This can speed up queries, but it increases the risk of data anomalies (e.g., if the product name or price changes, it must be updated in every row where that product appears).

## **Downsides of Denormalization**:

* **Data redundancy**: Leads to increased storage requirements and potential data anomalies.
* **Complexity in updates**: Modifying data requires more effort to keep the redundant copies synchronized.

## **Summary of Normal Forms**:

* **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Eliminates repeating groups by ensuring each column contains atomic values.
* **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Ensures no partial dependency (non-key attributes depend on the whole primary key).
* **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Removes transitive dependencies (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes).
* **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**: Ensures that every determinant is a candidate key.

## **Summary of Denormalization**:

* **Denormalization** involves adding redundancy to the database to improve read performance.
* It’s particularly useful in read-heavy applications, such as reporting or analytics.
* However, it can lead to data integrity issues and increased storage requirements.
