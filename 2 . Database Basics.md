# **2. Database Basics**

## **What is a Database?**

A **Database** is an organized collection of structured data, typically stored and accessed electronically. It is designed to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. A database can be simple (a flat file) or complex (a relational database) depending on how the data is structured and accessed.

## Key Characteristics of Databases:

* **Persistent Storage**: Data is stored in a non-volatile medium.
* **Structured Data**: Data is organized into tables or other formats (depending on the type of database).
* **Data Integrity**: Ensures data is accurate, consistent, and reliable.
* **Data Retrieval**: Provides efficient methods to query, update, and retrieve data.

## **Database vs. DBMS vs. RDBMS**

## **Database (DB)**:

* A **Database** is simply the **collection of data** that is organized in a particular way. It is the storage system where data resides.
* Example: A list of customer information, product details, etc.

## **Database Management System (DBMS)**:

* A **DBMS** is a software system designed to manage databases. It provides tools for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, as well as enforcing rules on how the data is organized and accessed.
* **Examples**: MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB.

  **Functions of DBMS**:

  * **Data Definition**: Define the structure of the data (tables, relationships).
  * **Data Manipulation**: Insert, update, delete, and query data.
  * **Data Security**: Manage permissions and access to data.
  * **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is accurate and consistent.

## **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**:

* An **RDBMS** is a specific type of DBMS that stores data in a **relational format** (tables) and uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage the data.
* **Relational Model**: The data is stored in tables (also called relations) and is related to other data in different tables through keys.
* **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

  **Key Features of an RDBMS**:

  * **Tables**: Data is stored in tables, which consist of rows and columns.
  * **Keys**: Keys are used to uniquely identify records (e.g., primary key) and establish relationships between tables (e.g., foreign key).
  * **Data Integrity**: RDBMS enforces integrity rules, such as referential integrity and entity integrity.

## **Relational Model**

The **Relational Model** is a method of storing and managing data in databases, where data is represented in the form of **tables (relations)**. Each table is a collection of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). The relational model allows for flexibility and powerful querying through **SQL**.

## Key Concepts of the Relational Model:

1. **Tables (Relations)**:

   * Data is stored in **tables**, each representing an entity (like a customer, product, or employee).
   * A table is made up of **rows** and **columns**.

2. **Rows (Tuples)**:

   * A **row** (or tuple) represents a single record in a table.
   * Each row has a unique identifier called the **primary key**.

3. **Columns (Attributes)**:

   * A **column** represents a specific attribute of the entity, such as name, age, or date of birth.
   * Each column has a specific **data type** (e.g., integer, string, date).

4. **Keys**:

   * **Primary Key (PK)**: A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
   * **Foreign Key (FK)**: A column that creates a relationship between two tables by pointing to the primary key of another table.
   * **Composite Key**: A combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify a record in a table.
   * **Unique Key**: Ensures that all values in a column are distinct, but unlike the primary key, it can accept null values.

5. **Relationships**:

   * Relationships are established between tables using **foreign keys**. These relationships help in combining data from multiple tables when queried.
   * Types of relationships:

     * **One-to-One**: One record in Table A is related to one record in Table B.
     * **One-to-Many**: One record in Table A is related to multiple records in Table B.
     * **Many-to-Many**: Multiple records in Table A are related to multiple records in Table B (often implemented using a junction table).

## **Tables, Rows, Columns, and Keys**

To understand the relational model better, let's break down **tables**, **rows**, **columns**, and **keys**:

## **1. Tables**

* Tables are the core unit of data storage in a database.
* Each table represents an entity and is defined by its **structure** (columns) and **constraints** (like primary keys, foreign keys, etc.).
* Example:

  * **Customers Table**:

    | CustomerID | Name    | Age | Address            |
    | ---------- | ------- | --- | ------------------ |
    | 1          | Alice   | 30  | 123 Main St, City  |
    | 2          | Bob     | 25  | 456 Oak Rd, Town   |
    | 3          | Charlie | 35  | 789 Pine Ave, City |

## **2. Rows**

* A **row** (also called a tuple) represents a single, unique record in a table.
* Each row corresponds to a single entity instance (like one customer, one order, etc.).
* In the example above, each row represents a unique customer with a unique **CustomerID**.

## **3. Columns**

* A **column** (also called an attribute) represents a field or attribute of the entity. Each column stores a particular type of data (e.g., strings, integers, dates).
* In the **Customers Table**, the columns are:

  * **CustomerID** (Integer)
  * **Name** (String)
  * **Age** (Integer)
  * **Address** (String)

## **4. Keys**

* **Primary Key**: The `CustomerID` in the example above is the **primary key** because it uniquely identifies each customer.

  * Primary keys must have unique values and cannot be NULL.
* **Foreign Key**: A **foreign key** is a column that links one table to another, ensuring referential integrity.

  * Example: A **Orders Table** could have a **CustomerID** column as a foreign key to link each order to a customer in the **Customers Table**.

  * **Orders Table**:

    | OrderID | CustomerID | ProductName | Quantity |
    | ------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- |
    | 1       | 1          | Laptop      | 1        |
    | 2       | 2          | Phone       | 2        |
    | 3       | 1          | Keyboard    | 3        |

  * The **CustomerID** in the **Orders Table** is a foreign key that refers to the **CustomerID** in the **Customers Table**.

## **Summary**

* **Database**: A collection of data stored in an organized manner.
* **DBMS**: Software that manages databases.
* **RDBMS**: A type of DBMS that organizes data in tables and uses relational models.
* **Relational Model**: Data is stored in tables with rows and columns, and relationships are formed through keys (primary and foreign).
* **Keys**:

  * **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row.
  * **Foreign Key**: Links two tables and ensures referential integrity.

This is the foundation of working with relational databases and will help in structuring and organizing data for more complex operations. Let me know if you'd like further elaboration on any of these concepts or if you're ready to dive into querying data!
