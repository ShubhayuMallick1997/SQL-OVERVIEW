# **19. Stored Procedures and Functions**

## **1. Stored Procedures**

A **Stored Procedure** is a **precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements** that can be executed by the database. Stored procedures are used to perform tasks such as data validation, complex calculations, or data transformations, which would otherwise require repetitive SQL code.

## **Creating Stored Procedures**

Stored procedures are created using the **`CREATE PROCEDURE`** statement.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    [parameter1 datatype, parameter2 datatype, ...]
AS
BEGIN
    SQL_statement1;
    SQL_statement2;
    ...
END;
```

* **`procedure_name`**: The name of the stored procedure.
* **`parameter1`, `parameter2`, ...**: Optional input parameters that are passed into the procedure when it is called.

## **Example 1: Simple Stored Procedure**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT employee_id, name, salary
    FROM employees;
END;
```

* This procedure fetches all employee details from the `employees` table when executed.

## **Executing a Stored Procedure**

Stored procedures are executed using the **`EXECUTE`** or **`EXEC`** keyword:

```sql
EXEC GetEmployeeDetails;
```

## **Example 2: Stored Procedure with Parameters**

You can create a stored procedure with input parameters to accept values when it is executed.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByDepartment
    @department_id INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT employee_id, name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = @department_id;
END;
```

* This procedure retrieves employee details for a given department by accepting the `department_id` as an input parameter.

## **Executing the Stored Procedure with Parameters**

To execute the stored procedure with a parameter, you pass the value when calling the procedure:

```sql
EXEC GetEmployeeByDepartment @department_id = 101;
```

---

## **2. Input and Output Parameters**

Stored procedures can have **input** and **output** parameters.

## **Input Parameters**

* **Input parameters** are used to pass values into the stored procedure.

## **Output Parameters**

* **Output parameters** allow the stored procedure to return a value back to the calling code.

## **Example 1: Stored Procedure with Input and Output Parameters**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeSalary
    @employee_id INT,
    @salary DECIMAL(10, 2) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT @salary = salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE employee_id = @employee_id;
END;
```

* In this example, the stored procedure `GetEmployeeSalary` accepts `@employee_id` as an **input parameter** and `@salary` as an **output parameter**. It retrieves the salary of the employee and stores it in the `@salary` variable.

## **Executing the Stored Procedure with Output Parameter**

To capture the output value from the procedure, you can declare a variable and pass it as an output parameter:

```sql
DECLARE @emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2);

EXEC GetEmployeeSalary @employee_id = 1, @salary = @emp_salary OUTPUT;

SELECT @emp_salary AS EmployeeSalary;
```

* This executes the procedure, captures the output in the `@emp_salary` variable, and then returns the value.

## **3. User-Defined Functions (UDF)**

A **User-Defined Function (UDF)** is a custom function that you can define to perform operations and return values. UDFs are often used to simplify complex expressions and calculations.

## **Types of User-Defined Functions**:

* **Scalar Functions**: Return a single value, such as a number or string.
* **Table-Valued Functions (TVF)**: Return a table (can be used like a `SELECT` statement).

## **Creating Scalar User-Defined Functions**

Scalar UDFs return a single value.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION function_name (@parameter1 datatype, @parameter2 datatype, ...)
RETURNS datatype
AS
BEGIN
    -- function logic
    RETURN expression;
END;
```

## **Example 1: Scalar UDF to Calculate Tax**

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION CalculateTax (@salary DECIMAL(10, 2))
RETURNS DECIMAL(10, 2)
AS
BEGIN
    RETURN @salary * 0.1;  -- Returns 10% of the salary as tax
END;
```

* This function calculates 10% tax on the given salary.

## **Executing Scalar UDF**

You can use the scalar function in a `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT name, salary, dbo.CalculateTax(salary) AS tax
FROM employees;
```

* This will return the name, salary, and tax of each employee.

## **Creating Table-Valued Functions (TVF)**

Table-valued functions return a table and are often used in situations where you need to return a set of rows based on a certain condition.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION function_name (@parameter datatype)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
);
```

## **Example 2: Table-Valued Function to Retrieve Employees by Department**

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDepartment (@department_id INT)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
    SELECT employee_id, name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = @department_id
);
```

## **Executing Table-Valued Function (TVF)**

You can use a **TVF** in the `FROM` clause of a query like a regular table:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM dbo.GetEmployeesByDepartment(101);
```

* This will return all employees from department `101` using the table-valued function.

## **Key Differences Between Stored Procedures and Functions**

| **Feature**           | **Stored Procedure**                                            | **Function**                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Return Type**       | Can perform operations but does not necessarily return a value. | Always returns a value (scalar or table).                    |
| **Usage**             | Can perform operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.             | Used to return a value and can be used in SELECT statements. |
| **Output Parameters** | Can have **input** and **output** parameters.                   | Always returns a value (cannot have output parameters).      |
| **Side Effects**      | Can modify the database (insert, update, delete).               | Cannot modify the database (read-only operations).           |

## **Summary**

* **Stored Procedures**: Used to perform a series of SQL statements, can have input/output parameters, and can perform modifications to the database.
* **User-Defined Functions (UDF)**: Custom functions to return values. They can be scalar (returning a single value) or table-valued (returning a table).

  * **Scalar UDF**: Returns a single value, often used in `SELECT` statements for calculations.
  * **Table-Valued Function (TVF)**: Returns a table and can be used in queries like a regular table.

Both stored procedures and functions help modularize and reuse SQL code, improving performance and maintainability in applications.
