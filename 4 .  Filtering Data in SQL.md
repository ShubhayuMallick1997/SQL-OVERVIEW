# **4. Filtering Data in SQL**

## **1. Comparison Operators**

Comparison operators are used to filter records based on conditions that compare values in columns to constants or other column values. These operators are fundamental when applying conditions to SQL queries.

## **Operators**:

* **`=`**: Equal to
* **`>`**: Greater than
* **`<`**: Less than
* **`>=`**: Greater than or equal to
* **`<=`**: Less than or equal to
* **`!=` or `<>`**: Not equal to

## **Example 1: Equal to (`=`)**

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
WHERE age = 30;
```

* This will return all employees who are exactly 30 years old.

## **Example 2: Greater Than (`>`)**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

* This will return all employees with a salary greater than `50000`.

## **Example 3: Less Than (`<`)**

```sql
SELECT name, experience
FROM employees
WHERE experience < 5;
```

* This will return all employees with less than 5 years of experience.

## **Example 4: Greater Than or Equal to (`>=`)**

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
WHERE age >= 40;
```

* This will return all employees aged 40 or older.

## **Example 5: Less Than or Equal to (`<=`)**

```sql
SELECT name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR' AND age <= 25;
```

* This will return all employees in the **HR** department who are 25 years old or younger.

## **Example 6: Not Equal to (`!=` or `<>`)**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary != 60000;
```

* This will return all employees whose salary is not equal to `60000`.

## **2. Logical Operators**

Logical operators allow you to combine multiple conditions in your `WHERE` clause. These operators can help refine your queries based on multiple criteria.

## **Operators**:

* **`AND`**: Returns true if all conditions are true.
* **`OR`**: Returns true if at least one condition is true.
* **`NOT`**: Reverses the logic of a condition (returns true if the condition is false).

## **Example 1: AND Operator**

```sql
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 70000;
```

* This will return all employees in the **IT** department with a salary greater than `70000`. Both conditions must be true.

## **Example 2: OR Operator**

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR' OR department = 'IT';
```

* This will return employees who work in either the **HR** or **IT** departments. Only one of the conditions needs to be true.

## **Example 3: NOT Operator**

```sql
SELECT name, department
FROM employees
WHERE NOT department = 'Sales';
```

* This will return all employees who do **not** work in the **Sales** department.

---

## **3. LIKE Operator**

The **`LIKE`** operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column. It is commonly used for matching text data with wildcard characters.

## **Syntax**:

* **`%`**: Represents any sequence of characters (including zero characters).
* **`_`**: Represents any single character.

## **Example 1: Using `%` (Wildcard)**

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
```

* This will return all employees whose name starts with `J` (e.g., **John**, **Jane**, etc.).

## **Example 2: Using `_` (Single Character Wildcard)**

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'Jo_n';
```

* This will return employees whose name matches the pattern `Jo_n`, such as **John** or **Joan**.

## **Example 3: Using `%` for Middle Matching**

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '%an%';
```

* This will return all employees whose name contains the substring `an` (e.g., **John**, **Jane**, **Daniel**).

---

## **4. IN Operator**

The **`IN`** operator allows you to specify multiple values in a `WHERE` clause. Itâ€™s a shorthand for multiple `OR` conditions.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column1 IN (value1, value2, ...);
```

## **Example 1: Using IN with Multiple Values**

```sql
SELECT name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Finance', 'IT');
```

* This will return employees who work in the **HR**, **Finance**, or **IT** departments.

## **Example 2: Using IN with Numbers**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary IN (40000, 50000, 60000);
```

* This will return employees with a salary of either `40000`, `50000`, or `60000`.

---

## **5. BETWEEN Operator**

The **`BETWEEN`** operator is used to filter the result set within a certain range. It is typically used for numerical values, dates, or even strings.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column1 BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

## **Example 1: Using BETWEEN for Numeric Ranges**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 70000;
```

* This will return employees whose salary is between `40000` and `70000`, inclusive.

## **Example 2: Using BETWEEN for Date Ranges**

```sql
SELECT name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
```

* This will return employees hired between **January 1, 2020** and **December 31, 2021**.

---

## **6. IS NULL**

The **`IS NULL`** operator is used to test for **NULL values** in a column. It is used to find records where a column does not contain any data (i.e., it is missing or undefined).

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column1 IS NULL;
```

## **Example 1: Finding NULL Values**

```sql
SELECT name, phone
FROM employees
WHERE phone IS NULL;
```

* This will return employees who do not have a phone number listed (i.e., the `phone` column contains `NULL`).

## **Example 2: Using IS NOT NULL**

```sql
SELECT name, address
FROM employees
WHERE address IS NOT NULL;
```

* This will return employees who have an address listed (i.e., the `address` column is not `NULL`).

---

## **Summary**

* **Comparison Operators** (`=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`): Used to compare values and filter records based on those comparisons.
* **Logical Operators** (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`): Used to combine multiple conditions in the `WHERE` clause.
* **LIKE**: Used for pattern matching in string values.
* **IN**: Used to filter results based on a list of values.
* **BETWEEN**: Used to filter data within a specified range.
* **IS NULL**: Used to check for missing (NULL) values in a column.

These operators and clauses are foundational for filtering data in SQL, allowing you to extract specific information from your database based on various conditions.
