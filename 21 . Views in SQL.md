# **21. Views in SQL**

## **1. What is a View?**

A **View** is a virtual table in SQL. It is essentially a **stored query** that you can reference like a table. A view does not store data physically; rather, it dynamically pulls data from one or more underlying tables when queried. Views are useful for encapsulating complex logic or simplifying repetitive queries.

## **2. Creating and Managing Views**

## **Creating a View**

A view is created using the **`CREATE VIEW`** statement, which defines the SQL query that the view will execute when accessed.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

* **`view_name`**: The name of the view.
* **`SELECT` statement**: The query that defines what data the view will return.

## **Example 1: Creating a Simple View**

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_details AS
SELECT employee_id, name, department_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

* This view, named `employee_details`, returns all employees who have a salary greater than 50,000.

## **Example 2: Creating a View with Multiple Tables (Join)**

```sql
CREATE VIEW department_employee_details AS
SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, d.department_name, e.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

* This view joins the `employees` table and the `departments` table and returns employee details along with the department name.

## **Managing Views**

Once a view is created, you can **select** from it like a regular table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_details;
```

* You can also **drop** a view using the `DROP VIEW` statement:

  ```sql
  DROP VIEW employee_details;
  ```

* **Altering** a view typically involves dropping and recreating it, as some databases do not support direct alteration of views.

## **3. Materialized Views**

A **Materialized View** is similar to a regular view but differs in that it **stores the result set** physically. Materialized views are typically used in scenarios where you want to improve the performance of complex queries by storing the result of the view, so it doesn't need to be recalculated every time itâ€™s queried.

## **Key Differences from Regular Views**:

* **Materialized Views** store data physically, whereas regular views are virtual tables.
* Materialized views can be **refreshed** periodically to keep the data up to date.
* **Performance**: Queries on materialized views are faster than regular views since the result set is precomputed and stored.

## **Creating a Materialized View**

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employee_summary AS
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

* This materialized view stores the summary of employees by department, including the count and average salary.

## **Refreshing a Materialized View**

Materialized views can be refreshed to keep the data updated. This can be done manually or automatically, depending on the database system.

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employee_summary;
```

* This will update the data in the `mv_employee_summary` materialized view.

## **Advantages of Materialized Views**:

* **Faster Query Performance**: Since the data is precomputed and stored, querying a materialized view is faster than recalculating the data on each query.
* **Reduced Database Load**: Materialized views reduce the load on the database by avoiding repetitive and complex queries.

## **Disadvantages**:

* **Storage**: Since the result set is stored, materialized views consume additional storage.
* **Staleness**: Data in materialized views can become outdated, so they need to be refreshed periodically.

## **4. Views vs Tables vs Subqueries**

## **Views**:

* **Definition**: A view is a virtual table that represents the result of a query.
* **Storage**: Does not store data physically; it executes the underlying query each time it is queried.
* **Use Case**: Simplifies complex queries, encapsulates logic, provides security by restricting access to certain columns or rows.
* **Performance**: Slower than tables because it has to run the query each time the view is accessed.
* **Updatable**: In some cases, views are updatable, meaning you can insert, update, or delete data through a view, but this depends on the complexity of the view.

## **Tables**:

* **Definition**: A table is a physical structure that stores data in rows and columns.
* **Storage**: Stores data physically.
* **Use Case**: Holds actual data used by applications.
* **Performance**: Data retrieval from tables is usually faster than from views because the data is physically stored.
* **Updatable**: Tables are always updatable unless restricted by constraints.

## **Subqueries**:

* **Definition**: A subquery is a query embedded within another query. It can return a single value (scalar subquery), a set of values (multi-row subquery), or a table (table subquery).
* **Storage**: Subqueries do not store data; they are executed each time the parent query is run.
* **Use Case**: Subqueries are useful when you need to calculate intermediate results or filter data using a query inside another query.
* **Performance**: Subqueries are executed every time the parent query runs, which can be less efficient for large datasets.
* **Updatable**: Subqueries are typically not updatable.

## **Comparison of Views, Tables, and Subqueries**

| **Performance** | Slower (since data is not stored)                                 | Faster (direct data access)             | Slower (executed every time the parent query runs) |
| **Updatable**   | Can be updatable (depends on complexity)                          | Always updatable                        | Typically not updatable                            |

## **Summary**

* **Views**: Provide a way to simplify complex queries and encapsulate logic, but they do not store data physically. They are slower than tables because they execute the underlying query each time they are used.
* **Materialized Views**: Store the result of a query physically and can be refreshed. They offer improved performance at the cost of additional storage.
* **Tables**: The primary structure for storing data in a relational database.
* **Subqueries**: Used to execute a query within another query, often for intermediate results, but they do not store data and can affect performance.

Views and materialized views are both helpful for optimizing data access and simplifying complex queries, but you should choose between them based on your specific use case (e.g., performance vs. storage requirements).
