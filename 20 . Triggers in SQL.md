# **20. Triggers in SQL**

## **1. What is a Trigger?**

A **trigger** is a special kind of stored procedure that automatically executes when a **specific event** (like an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) occurs on a table. Triggers are associated with tables and are executed **before** or **after** the event that they are defined to respond to.

## **2. Creating Triggers (BEFORE, AFTER)**

Triggers can be classified into two main types based on when they are executed:

1. **BEFORE Trigger**: Executes **before** the specified event (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is performed on the table. This allows you to modify the data before it is inserted, updated, or deleted.
2. **AFTER Trigger**: Executes **after** the specified event has been completed. This allows you to perform actions such as logging, auditing, or maintaining referential integrity.

## **Syntax for Creating a Trigger**:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{ BEFORE | AFTER } { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE }
ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Trigger actions (SQL statements)
END;
```

* **trigger\_name**: Name of the trigger.
* **{ BEFORE | AFTER }**: Specifies whether the trigger should be fired before or after the event.
* **{ INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE }**: Specifies the event that triggers the action.
* **FOR EACH ROW**: Defines that the trigger will be executed for each row affected by the event.
* **Trigger Actions**: These are the SQL statements that are executed when the trigger is fired.

---

## **3. Trigger Events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)**

Triggers can be set to respond to different types of events on a table:

## **INSERT Trigger**:

* An **INSERT** trigger is fired **after** or **before** a new row is inserted into the table.

## **Example 1: BEFORE INSERT Trigger**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_insert
BEFORE INSERT
ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Perform actions before inserting the row (e.g., data validation)
    IF NEW.salary < 1000 THEN
        SET NEW.salary = 1000; -- Set minimum salary to 1000
    END IF;
END;
```

* This trigger ensures that if an employee is about to be inserted with a salary below 1000, the salary will be automatically adjusted to 1000 **before** the insert operation.

## **Example 2: AFTER INSERT Trigger**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_insert
AFTER INSERT
ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Insert a log record after a new employee is added
    INSERT INTO audit_log (action, description)
    VALUES ('INSERT', CONCAT('New employee added: ', NEW.name));
END;
```

* This trigger logs the action every time a new employee is inserted into the `employees` table.

## **UPDATE Trigger**:

* An **UPDATE** trigger is fired **after** or **before** a row in the table is updated.

## **Example 3: BEFORE UPDATE Trigger**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_update
BEFORE UPDATE
ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Validate salary before updating
    IF NEW.salary < OLD.salary THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Salary cannot be decreased';
    END IF;
END;
```

* This trigger prevents salary reductions by raising an error if an employee's salary is updated to a lower value.

## **Example 4: AFTER UPDATE Trigger**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_update
AFTER UPDATE
ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Log the update to the audit table
    INSERT INTO audit_log (action, description)
    VALUES ('UPDATE', CONCAT('Employee updated: ', OLD.name, ' -> ', NEW.name));
END;
```

* This trigger logs changes when employee details are updated.

## **DELETE Trigger**:

* A **DELETE** trigger is fired **after** or **before** a row is deleted from the table.

## **Example 5: BEFORE DELETE Trigger**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_delete
BEFORE DELETE
ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Check if employee has any active projects before deleting
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM projects WHERE employee_id = OLD.employee_id) THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Cannot delete employee with active projects';
    END IF;
END;
```

* This trigger prevents the deletion of an employee if they are associated with any active projects.

## **Example 6: AFTER DELETE Trigger**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_delete
AFTER DELETE
ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Log the deletion to an audit table
    INSERT INTO audit_log (action, description)
    VALUES ('DELETE', CONCAT('Employee deleted: ', OLD.name));
END;
```

* This trigger logs the deletion of an employee to an `audit_log` table.

---

## **4. Managing Trigger Actions**

Trigger actions are the SQL statements that are executed when a trigger is fired. These actions can include:

1. **Modifying Data**: Triggers can modify the data before or after it is inserted, updated, or deleted.

   **Example**: In a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger, you might automatically generate a timestamp or modify the value of a column before the record is inserted.

2. **Enforcing Business Logic**: Triggers can be used to enforce certain business rules, such as preventing updates or deletes, or ensuring data integrity across related tables.

3. **Logging and Auditing**: Triggers can log changes to a table (e.g., insertions, updates, or deletions) to an audit table for tracking purposes.

4. **Raising Errors**: Triggers can be used to raise exceptions when certain conditions are met. This can be useful for preventing illegal operations.

   **Example**:

   ```sql
   CREATE TRIGGER prevent_invalid_age_update
   BEFORE UPDATE
   ON employees
   FOR EACH ROW
   BEGIN
       IF NEW.age < 18 THEN
           SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
           SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Employee age cannot be less than 18';
       END IF;
   END;
   ```

## **5. Disabling and Dropping Triggers**

## **Disabling Triggers**:

Some databases allow you to temporarily disable triggers, which is useful for bulk data operations or administrative tasks.

```sql
-- Disable a trigger
ALTER TABLE employees DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_name;
```

## **Dropping Triggers**:

If you no longer need a trigger, you can drop it.

```sql
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name;
```

## **6. Summary of Trigger Types**

| **Trigger Type**  | **Description**                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **BEFORE INSERT** | Fires before a new row is inserted into the table. |
| **AFTER INSERT**  | Fires after a new row is inserted into the table.  |
| **BEFORE UPDATE** | Fires before an existing row is updated.           |
| **AFTER UPDATE**  | Fires after an existing row is updated.            |
| **BEFORE DELETE** | Fires before a row is deleted from the table.      |
| **AFTER DELETE**  | Fires after a row is deleted from the table.       |

---

## **Summary**

* **Triggers** automate actions like validation, logging, or preventing certain actions in response to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.
* **BEFORE** triggers allow modification or validation of data before the operation is committed, while **AFTER** triggers are typically used for actions like logging after the operation has completed.
* Triggers provide a way to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, and ensure consistency across tables.
