# **5. Sorting Data in SQL**

## **1. ORDER BY Clause**

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to **sort the result set** returned by a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. By default, the results are sorted in **ascending** order (lowest to highest), but you can specify the sort direction using the `ASC` or `DESC` keywords.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
```

* **`ASC`** (ascending) orders the results from **lowest to highest**.
* **`DESC`** (descending) orders the results from **highest to lowest**.

## **2. ASC and DESC**

## **ASC (Ascending)**

When you use `ASC`, SQL will return the data in **ascending order**. This is the default sorting order if you don't specify any sort order.

* **For numeric data**, it sorts from the **smallest** to the **largest**.
* **For text data**, it sorts from **A to Z**.
* **For date/time data**, it sorts from **earliest** to **latest**.

## **DESC (Descending)**

When you use `DESC`, SQL will return the data in **descending order**. This sorts data from the **largest to the smallest** for numeric data, from **Z to A** for text data, and from **latest** to **earliest** for date/time data.

## **3. Example Usage of `ORDER BY`**

## **Example 1: Sorting in Ascending Order (ASC)**

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
ORDER BY age ASC;
```

* This will return employees sorted by their `age` in ascending order (youngest to oldest). If `ASC` is omitted, it will sort in ascending order by default.

## **Example 2: Sorting in Descending Order (DESC)**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

* This will return employees sorted by their `salary` in descending order (highest salary to lowest salary).

## **Example 3: Sorting by Multiple Columns**

You can also sort by more than one column. When sorting by multiple columns, SQL will first sort by the first column and then by the second column, and so on.

```sql
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;
```

* This query will first sort employees by **department** in **ascending** order (A to Z). Then, within each department, it will sort employees by their **salary** in **descending** order (highest to lowest).

## **Example 4: Sorting by Text Data (ASC and DESC)**

```sql
SELECT name, department
FROM employees
ORDER BY department ASC, name DESC;
```

* This will return employees sorted by their `department` in ascending order, and within each department, sorted by their `name` in descending order (Z to A).

## **Example 5: Sorting by Date**

```sql
SELECT name, hire_date
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
```

* This will return employees sorted by their `hire_date` in descending order (latest hired to earliest hired).

---

## **4. Combining Sorting with Filtering**

You can use the `ORDER BY` clause in combination with the `WHERE` clause to first filter your data and then sort the results.

## **Example 1: Filtered and Sorted Data**

```sql
SELECT name, age, department
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR'
ORDER BY age DESC;
```

* This will first filter employees who work in the **HR** department and then sort them by their `age` in descending order (oldest to youngest).

---

## **5. Summary**

* **`ORDER BY`**: A clause used to sort the result set in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order based on one or more columns.
* **`ASC`**: Sorts in ascending order (default for `ORDER BY`).
* **`DESC`**: Sorts in descending order.
* You can sort by **one or more columns**, and the order of sorting can differ for each column.

Sorting is a powerful feature in SQL that allows you to organize and display your data in the most meaningful way based on your needs. It is especially helpful when analyzing data, generating reports, or preparing the data for further processing.
