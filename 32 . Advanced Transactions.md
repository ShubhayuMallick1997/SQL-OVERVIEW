## **1. Distributed Transactions**

A **distributed transaction** involves multiple databases or systems, typically across different servers or locations, and ensures that operations are consistent across all participating systems. Distributed transactions are common in systems with microservices or when databases are spread across multiple servers.

## **Key Features of Distributed Transactions**:

* **Atomicity**: The entire transaction must succeed or fail across all systems.
* **Consistency**: The system must always transition from one consistent state to another, even in the case of failures.
* **Isolation**: Each transaction must be isolated from others, preventing interference.
* **Durability**: Once committed, the transaction's changes must persist, even in case of system failure.

In a **distributed environment**, a transaction might involve multiple databases, each responsible for part of the data. To maintain consistency, we use protocols like **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**.

## **Challenges in Distributed Transactions**:

* **Network Failures**: Communication issues between different systems can cause transaction failures.
* **Latency**: The time it takes to propagate changes across systems.
* **Data Consistency**: Ensuring that all participating systems remain in sync after the transaction is committed.

## **2. Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**

The **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)** protocol is a standard for ensuring that a distributed transaction is **atomic** across multiple databases. It ensures that all databases involved in the transaction either commit or roll back the transaction, guaranteeing consistency across the system.

## **How 2PC Works**:

1. **Phase 1 - Prepare Phase**:

   * The **coordinator** (typically the transaction manager) sends a **prepare** request to all participating databases (called **participants** or **voters**).
   * Each participant votes either **YES** (if it can commit the transaction) or **NO** (if it cannot commit the transaction due to an error or constraint violation).
   * If any participant votes **NO**, the coordinator asks all participants to **rollback**.

2. **Phase 2 - Commit or Abort Phase**:

   * If all participants vote **YES**, the coordinator sends a **commit** request to all participants, instructing them to finalize the transaction.
   * If any participant votes **NO**, the coordinator sends a **rollback** request to all participants, instructing them to undo any changes made during the transaction.

## **Diagram of 2PC**:

```
Coordinator  <--->  Participant 1 (Prepare/Commit/Rollback)
   |                         |
   |----->  Participant 2 (Prepare/Commit/Rollback)
   |                         |
   |----->  Participant 3 (Prepare/Commit/Rollback)
```

## **Example: Two-Phase Commit for Bank Transfer**:

Consider a transaction involving two databases: one for the **sender’s account** and another for the **receiver’s account**.

1. **Prepare Phase**: The coordinator sends a **prepare** request to both databases.

   * **Sender database** checks if the balance is sufficient and votes **YES**.
   * **Receiver database** votes **YES**.

2. **Commit Phase**: Both databases commit the transaction if no participant voted **NO**. If any participant voted **NO**, the coordinator requests a **rollback**.

## **Advantages of 2PC**:

* Guarantees **atomicity** across distributed systems.
* Ensures data consistency and **data integrity**.

## **Disadvantages of 2PC**:

* **Blocking**: If a participant crashes during the protocol, the coordinator is blocked, and the transaction is stuck in an indeterminate state.
* **Performance Overhead**: 2PC requires multiple round trips between the coordinator and participants, which can introduce latency.

## **3. Deadlocks and Lock Management**

**Deadlocks** occur when two or more transactions are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release locks on resources (e.g., tables or rows). This leads to a situation where no progress can be made. Deadlock detection and resolution are critical aspects of database transaction management.

## **How Deadlocks Happen**:

* **Transaction A** locks **Resource 1** and waits for **Resource 2**.
* **Transaction B** locks **Resource 2** and waits for **Resource 1**.
* Both transactions are blocked, and neither can proceed, resulting in a **deadlock**.

## **Deadlock Detection**:

Databases use algorithms to detect deadlocks by checking for **cycles** in the wait-for graph, where transactions are waiting for resources that are locked by others.

## **Deadlock Resolution**:

Once a deadlock is detected, the database system typically resolves it by **killing one of the transactions** to break the cycle. The transaction that is killed is rolled back, allowing the other transaction to proceed.

## **Example: Deadlock Scenario**

```sql
-- Transaction A
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Transaction B
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Transaction A tries to update account 2, and Transaction B tries to update account 1
-- This results in a deadlock, and neither can proceed.
```

## **Deadlock Prevention**:

* **Locking Order**: One way to prevent deadlocks is to enforce a consistent **lock acquisition order** for all transactions. For example, always lock **Resource 1** before **Resource 2**.
* **Timeouts**: Setting timeouts for acquiring locks can help reduce deadlock occurrences, as transactions that cannot acquire a lock within a certain period are automatically rolled back.
* **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: This method assumes that deadlocks are rare and allows transactions to execute without locks, verifying data integrity before committing.

## **Lock Types**:

* **Shared Locks (S-Locks)**: Allow multiple transactions to read a resource but prevent any transaction from modifying it.
* **Exclusive Locks (X-Locks)**: Prevent other transactions from reading or modifying the resource until the lock is released.

## **Lock Granularity**:

* **Row-level Locking**: Locks are applied to individual rows, providing finer control but increasing overhead.
* **Table-level Locking**: Locks an entire table, which is less granular but simpler to manage.

## **Lock Escalation**:

Lock escalation occurs when the database automatically upgrades from row-level locks to a table-level lock when there are too many row-level locks, reducing overhead but increasing the risk of blocking.

* **Distributed transactions** allow systems to ensure data consistency across multiple databases or servers, but they introduce complexity and potential performance overhead.
* The **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)** protocol is a standard for ensuring atomicity in distributed transactions, though it can suffer from blocking and performance issues.
* **Deadlocks** are an inherent risk in transactional systems, but they can be detected and resolved using algorithms. Proper **lock management** and **deadlock prevention** strategies are essential to ensure smooth transaction processing.

By managing distributed transactions, deadlocks, and locks effectively, you can ensure that your database systems maintain consistency, reliability, and performance in complex, multi-node environments.
