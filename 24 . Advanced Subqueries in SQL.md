# **24. Advanced Subqueries in SQL**

## **1. EXISTS vs IN**

Both **EXISTS** and **IN** are used to filter data based on the results of a subquery. However, they are used in slightly different contexts and can have different performance implications.

## **EXISTS**

The **EXISTS** operator checks whether the subquery returns **any rows**. It returns `TRUE` if the subquery returns one or more rows, and `FALSE` if no rows are returned. The **EXISTS** clause typically works faster when the subquery checks for the existence of rows rather than returning values.

* **EXISTS** is used when you want to check the existence of records in the subquery.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

## **Example**: Using EXISTS

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM departments d WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id AND d.department_name = 'HR');
```

* This query returns the `name` of employees who belong to the `HR` department. The `EXISTS` subquery checks if there is a matching department in the `departments` table for the employee's `department_id`.

## **IN**

The **IN** operator checks if a value is **present in a set of values** returned by the subquery. It is typically used when the subquery returns a list of values that you want to compare against a column.

* **IN** is used when you need to compare a column against a set of possible values returned by the subquery.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE column1 IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

## **Example**: Using IN

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'HR');
```

* This query returns the names of employees who belong to the `HR` department. The `IN` subquery selects all `department_id`s in the `departments` table where the `department_name` is `HR`.

## **Key Differences Between EXISTS and IN**:

| **Criteria**      | **EXISTS**                                                          | **IN**                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Case**      | Used to check if the subquery returns any rows.                     | Used to check if a value is in a list of values.                 |
| **Performance**   | More efficient when checking existence of rows.                     | Can be less efficient if the subquery returns many values.       |
| **Subquery**      | The subquery typically returns a constant value (e.g., `SELECT 1`). | The subquery returns actual column values.                       |
| **Null Handling** | Does not consider NULL values.                                      | Can return `FALSE` if NULLs are present in the subquery results. |

## **2. Scalar Subqueries**

A **scalar subquery** is a subquery that returns **only a single value** (one row and one column). Scalar subqueries can be used wherever a single value is expected, such as in the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `HAVING` clauses.

## **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE condition) AS alias
FROM table1;
```

## **Example**: Using a Scalar Subquery in a SELECT Clause

```sql
SELECT name,
       (SELECT department_name FROM departments WHERE department_id = e.department_id) AS department_name
FROM employees e;
```

* This query retrieves the `name` of employees along with the corresponding `department_name` by using a scalar subquery in the `SELECT` clause.

## **Example**: Using a Scalar Subquery in the WHERE Clause

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

* This query returns employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of all employees. The scalar subquery returns a single value, which is the average salary.

## **Key Points about Scalar Subqueries**:

* They return **exactly one value**.
* They are used wherever a single value is required, such as comparison or calculations.

## **3. Nested Subqueries**

A **nested subquery** is a subquery inside another subquery. This allows you to perform multi-level filtering, making queries more powerful and flexible. Nested subqueries can appear in the `WHERE`, `FROM`, or `SELECT` clauses.

## **Example 1: Nested Subqueries in the WHERE Clause**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'HR');
```

* This query retrieves the names and salaries of employees who belong to the `HR` department. The inner subquery selects the `department_id` for the `HR` department, and the outer query uses it to filter employees.

## **Example 2: Nested Subqueries in the FROM Clause**

You can use nested subqueries in the `FROM` clause to create a temporary table for further operations.

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM (SELECT department_id, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000) AS high_salary_employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

* This query calculates the average salary for each department but only considers employees with a salary greater than 50,000. The nested subquery retrieves employees with salaries greater than 50,000, and the outer query performs aggregation.

## **Example 3: Nested Subqueries with Multiple Levels**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id
                        FROM departments
                        WHERE department_name = (SELECT department_name FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York'));
```

* This query uses a nested subquery to filter employees working in departments located in **New York**. It first finds the `department_name` for **New York**, then finds the corresponding `department_id`, and finally retrieves the employees in that department.

## **Summary of Subquery Types**

| **Subquery Type**   | **Description**                                            | **Use Case**                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EXISTS**          | Checks if the subquery returns any rows.                   | Used to check for existence (e.g., checking if a related row exists).           |
| **IN**              | Checks if a value is in the list returned by the subquery. | Used for comparisons with a list of values.                                     |
| **Scalar Subquery** | Returns a single value (one row, one column).              | Used when a single value is required in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `HAVING` clauses. |
| **Nested Subquery** | A subquery inside another subquery.                        | Used for multi-level filtering or intermediate results.                         |

---

## **Summary**

* **EXISTS** vs **IN**: Use `EXISTS` when checking for the existence of rows, and use `IN` when you need to compare a column to a set of values.
* **Scalar Subqueries**: Return a single value, and can be used for comparisons or calculations.
* **Nested Subqueries**: Allow multiple layers of queries, which is useful for complex filtering and data transformations.

Advanced subqueries allow you to write more powerful and flexible queries that can retrieve data based on complex conditions or intermediate results.
