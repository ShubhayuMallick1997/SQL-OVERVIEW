# **28. Full-Text Search in SQL**

## **1. Full-Text Indexes**

A **Full-Text Index** is a special kind of index designed to optimize full-text searches, allowing for faster and more efficient searching within large text data fields (like `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, or `CHAR`). Full-text indexes allow you to perform searches that look for words, phrases, or even parts of words within text columns.

## **Creating a Full-Text Index**

In most SQL databases (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL), full-text indexing requires creating a full-text index on a column that contains text data. This index is then used to perform optimized full-text searches.

## **Syntax for Creating a Full-Text Index**:

In **SQL Server**:

```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ON table_name (column_name)
KEY INDEX index_name;
```

In **MySQL**:

```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name);
```

* **`column_name`**: The text column where you want to perform the full-text search.
* **`index_name`**: The name of the index.
* The full-text index is usually created on text-based columns like `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, or `CHAR`.

## **Example: Creating a Full-Text Index in SQL Server**:

```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ON articles (title, body)
KEY INDEX pk_articles;
```

* This creates a full-text index on the `title` and `body` columns of the `articles` table. The primary key index (`pk_articles`) is used as the key for the full-text index.

## **Key Points**:

* Full-text indexes are **optimized for searching** large text data efficiently.
* Full-text indexing supports searching for **words, phrases**, or even **word proximity**.
* These indexes require maintenance when the underlying data is updated.

## **2. SEARCH Conditions (CONTAINS, FREETEXT)**

Once a full-text index is created, you can use specific search conditions to search for words, phrases, or patterns within the indexed columns. In SQL Server, you use the `CONTAINS` and `FREETEXT` predicates for full-text search queries.

## **CONTAINS** Predicate

The **`CONTAINS`** predicate is used to search for specific words, phrases, or word forms within a column that has a full-text index. It allows more control over the search, such as searching for **exact words**, **wildcards**, or **prefixes**.

### **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE CONTAINS(column_name, 'search_condition');
```

* **`column_name`**: The column that is indexed with a full-text index.
* **`search_condition`**: The word, phrase, or pattern to search for.

### **Example 1: Simple Search for a Word**:

```sql
SELECT title, body
FROM articles
WHERE CONTAINS(body, 'SQL');
```

* This query searches for the word **"SQL"** anywhere within the `body` column of the `articles` table.

### **Example 2: Searching for a Phrase**:

```sql
SELECT title, body
FROM articles
WHERE CONTAINS(body, '"full-text search"');
```

* This query searches for the exact phrase **"full-text search"** in the `body` column.

### **Example 3: Searching for Word Forms (Prefix Search)**:

```sql
SELECT title, body
FROM articles
WHERE CONTAINS(body, 'FORMSOF(INFLECTIONAL, "run")');
```

* This query searches for any word forms related to "run" (e.g., "running", "ran", "runs").

### **Example 4: Using Wildcards in Search**:

```sql
SELECT title, body
FROM articles
WHERE CONTAINS(body, 'dog*');
```

* This query searches for any word that starts with **"dog"**, such as "dogs", "dogged", etc.

## **FREETEXT** Predicate

The **`FREETEXT`** predicate performs a more **generalized search** by searching for the meaning of a phrase or word, rather than an exact match. It allows you to search for words or phrases **in a natural language format**.

### **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE FREETEXT(column_name, 'search_phrase');
```

* **`search_phrase`**: The phrase or word(s) you want to search for. `FREETEXT` ignores punctuation and performs a more flexible search.

### **Example 1: Searching for a Phrase**:

```sql
SELECT title, body
FROM articles
WHERE FREETEXT(body, 'searching for information');
```

* This query searches for any **documents** that discuss the **concept** of "searching for information". The results are more likely to include relevant documents, even if the exact words "searching for information" donâ€™t appear, as `FREETEXT` uses semantic analysis.

### **Example 2: Searching for Multiple Words**:

```sql
SELECT title, body
FROM articles
WHERE FREETEXT(body, 'full-text indexing in SQL');
```

* This query looks for any document that has content related to **"full-text indexing in SQL"**, considering various word forms and related terms.

## **Key Differences Between CONTAINS and FREETEXT**:

| **Feature**     | **CONTAINS**                                  | **FREETEXT**                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Search Type** | Exact matches, phrases, and word forms.       | Searches for meaning, not exact matches.        |
| **Flexibility** | More control (exact words, wildcards, etc.).  | Less control, more natural language search.     |
| **Use Case**    | Exact word or phrase searches, or word forms. | Searching for semantic meaning in natural text. |

## **3. Performance Considerations**

* **Full-text search** with **CONTAINS** and **FREETEXT** is optimized for text searches and can handle large datasets efficiently compared to using the `LIKE` operator, especially with wildcard searches.
* **Index Maintenance**: Full-text indexes require maintenance, especially when the underlying data is updated, as the index must be refreshed.
* **Complex Queries**: Using `CONTAINS` and `FREETEXT` predicates in combination with **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** can help refine searches and perform complex text searches.

## **4. Full-Text Search Example Scenario**

Imagine you have an **articles** table with a **`content`** column that contains long textual descriptions. You want to find articles that discuss topics related to **"SQL performance"**.

## **Step 1: Create a Full-Text Index**:

```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ON articles (content)
KEY INDEX pk_articles;
```

## **Step 2: Querying with `CONTAINS`**:

```sql
SELECT title, content
FROM articles
WHERE CONTAINS(content, '"SQL performance"');
```

## **Step 3: Querying with `FREETEXT`**:

```sql
SELECT title, content
FROM articles
WHERE FREETEXT(content, 'SQL optimization techniques');
```

* `CONTAINS` will return rows that contain the exact phrase **"SQL performance"**, while `FREETEXT` will find articles that talk about the topic of **SQL optimization**, even if the exact phrase isn't present.

## **Summary**

| **Feature**     | **CONTAINS**                                          | **FREETEXT**                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**  | Searches for exact words, phrases, or word forms.     | Searches for the meaning of words/phrases. |
| **Control**     | High, with options for wildcards and phrase searches. | Lower, focusing on semantic meaning.       |
| **Performance** | Optimized for precise, indexed searches.              | Useful for natural language queries.       |

* **Full-text indexes** help you perform fast, efficient searches on large textual data.
* **CONTAINS** allows for precise and controlled text searches (e.g., word forms, phrases), while **FREETEXT** provides a more flexible, meaning-based search for natural language queries.
